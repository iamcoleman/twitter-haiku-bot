I see you've followed my mother-in-law onto the freeway.  She gets on the on-ramp, sees a car on the freeway, oh, a half mile back or so, and panics and hits the brakes. Seriously, I don't know how she hasn't caused a wreck or twelve by now.My local section of highway has an on-ramp that turns into a quarter-mile exit lane for the next exit. A lot of people get on the highway with the intention of taking the next exit, and simply stay in the lane, never getting up to highway speed because they're getting back off a quarter mile up the road. This is always infuriating because I NEVER take that exit, and am forced to sit behind them while they cruise at 45 mph up to their exit while I'm trying to merge left with cars flying by at 70 mph.I assume they have a birthday cake in the car and don’t want to muss the frosting.  DC has speed cameras on the entrances and exits to 395- ramp speed limit is 35/interstate is 55

Needless to say, people get hit a lot by these cameras and it makes merging (often from left exits) a nightmare My dad does this, and I asked him why he does it, straight up, "I want to get good gas mileage, and you don't get good mileage by accelerating hard."  So, there is one old man's answers.Because its illegal to pass on the shoulder, and an idiot is doing 30MPH in front of me.I'm in the heart medication business.  Just trying to create conditions that will lead to new clients (i.e. those behind me).I feel like the answer is that a lot of poor drivers assume that in all situations slower=safer when really not merging at similar speeds to the roadway being entered is incredibly dangerous. When I took driver's education they specifically mentioned things like merging at speed but I don't know if that's the same for everyone.I had a lady tell me once that she takes it slow and easy with on ramps because "professionals say it saves gas.".... She didn't understand my logic when I told her that when she does this, she causes accidents and traffic jams.  Thus she may save a few drops, but overall she fucks everything up.Merging into traffic is scary, so you gotta make sure the speed differential between you and the traffic is as high as humanly possible.  This validates the belief that merging into traffic is scary, so you better go even slower next time.Because in Massachusetts half the time there is a stop sign on the on ramp. Looking at you Route 1.

Edit: To those of you telling me that Route 1 is not a highway go for a drive on the Northeast Expressway all the way to I95 and get back to me. And remember you're in MA where the speed limit says 55 and you still get passed in the right hand lane while going 85.

Edit 2: Thanks for the gold fellow Masshole, I'm enjoying all the dick measuring over whose highway's are worstMy step-mom actually got a ticket for doing 45 in a 55 MPH zone. She was going onto i-96 eastbound for one mile and "didn't feel like accelerating for just one mile". So, the cop gave her a ticket for impeding traffic. She's probably slowly merging into traffic somewhere right now. If you see her, wave hi to her.Lots of people have poor spacial recognition while driving. Lots of people also should have been taken off the road a decade ago.In the UK we call these slip roads. I drive a lot in my job and people who do this are usually being cautious and looking to avoid collisions, but in reality it is bloody dangerous and increasing the chance of a very serious accident.

In the highway code it explicitly says "check the traffic on the motorway and match your speed to fit safely into the traffic flow in the left-hand lane" - so the speed of your vehicle and the vehicles on the carriageway need to be MATCHED, it's not rocket science, the danger comes from differing speeds. If the cars are moving 
at 70, crawling in at 30 puts you, the fast moving vehicles on the carriageway, and the drivers behind you being forced to drive at your speed, at far greater risk than is necessary.Also: people who drive at dusk or during rainstorms without headlights on, why?How much signal I need to cut across 8 lanes? None? Ok, I turn now. Good luck everybody else!This Mirage’s double digit horsepower won’t give me anymore A lack of confidence and skill behind the wheel.Are these the same people that do 50 in a 65, until you attempt to pass them, and then they go as fast as necessary to prevent you from passing them. Until you concede and get back behind them, where they gradually slow back down towards 50mph?

They’re worse than ISISI think there should be a special hell for those assholes who decide to move INTO the far right lane at the exact spot where oncomming cars are trying to merge in.

You check over your left shoulder and see a nice gap to move in, then all of a sudden - nope, some dumbass decides that's the time to move into the slow lane. WHY?

Seriously, fuck those people.For the same reason I have to slow down early and make people angry when exiting -- my town simply doesn't make the on and off-ramps nearly as long as they need to be for my shitty 4 cylinder to get up to safe merging speed, or down to safe exiting speed. There's accidents all the time because of this. Because they have a death wish. To anyone who does this, don't merge into the highway doing residential road speed.  You're causing so many problems for everyone around you and it's dangerous.  

If you're going to go that damn slow, stay on the feeder.Because I'm a fucking idiot




Edit: WOW thanks for the gold mystery persons. The person in front of me has neglected the right most pedal. My car has crappy acceleration and the onramps in my city are way too short. I'm trying! Dispatch gives me the truck with 600k miles and this is literally as fast as it goes. I want to go faster as much as you want me to go faster.I was at the DMV and saw 2 people holding a very frail old man up, one on each arm,  to the view master style eye test so he could get his license.This is infuriatingly common in Illinois for some reason. People here just don't fucking accelerate until they're ON the highway, never before.

Never saw this occurrence with this much frequency until I moved here. The ramp is for accelerating up to highway speed dammit!
I have another part to this. People who have the entire highway to yourself and you see a car merging as fast as it can, why do you refuse to get over? I understand if you can’t get over because of other vehicles, but not when the other lane is clear Because most of the ramps in my area are actually very sharp turns. Some of these rims even have signs stating to go no faster than 15 to 25 miles per hour, including some areas where the highway speed is 70 miles per hourFollow up PSA, and this may come as a bit of a shock to some of you, but the far left lane on the interstate is not your personal highway. If you aren't actively passing cars, you shouldn't be in it at all. Let alone camped over there, oblivious to the world around you. What is it with Toyota Prius or any Subaru driver that generally seem to be self designated Highway speed monitors, leading parades of frustrated drivers in the passing lane.  
I am always stuck passing on the right and I give them a glance as they are driving along oblivious.This happens all the time where I am from, too. I know a few people who do this too. From what I've gathered it is a perfect storm of several things that happens to *ahem* "poor" drivers:

1) They are afraid to hit the gas. In residential driving you almost never need to really floor it. Revving the engine up makes it make loud scary sounds like you're gonna break it. It makes people scared. They would prefer to accelerate at the same pace that they normally do in all other aspects of their driving. And in a little economy sedan that just isn't enough to get up to the right speed on the straightaway.

2) They are unwilling to accelerate in the clover part of the onramp, because again accelerating while turning  and experiencing those sideways forces is scary and you normally never do it in residential driving. If they don't won't want to floor it on the straightaway they really ought to accelerate out of the clover and be at 40-50 before they even hit the straightaway, then they would have been able to comfortably get up to the 60-65 you need to be going to merge... but people don't want to accelerate while turning so they end up too slow when it's time to merge 

3) People are afraid of fast highway speeds because they are accustomed to the slow driving on residential roads that they were just doing. It naturally "feels too fast" and they are driving based on their gut feelings instead of objectively evaluating the traffic around them.


What drives me absolutely bonkers though, are the people who slowly poke up the onramp causing traffic behind them and THEN they accelerate all the way up to 80 and fly down the left lane weaving in and out of traffic. Like not only are you speeding your ass off but you JUST demonstrated how little grasp of the traffic around you you have. You're a menace!I recently got a new car, but before that my car (02 Honda Accord) physically couldn't speed up fast enough to get above ~50 until I was already on the highway Is this the curve on the ramp or the straightaway? 

If it’s the curve, it’s because I don’t want to slide into the ditch. 

If it’s the straightaway, I’m stomping on the gas. _racks shotgun and sits on stool in the corner writing down names_That wasn't even about merging. The red car just didn't know what fucking lane he was inI mean, you could live in my part of PA where we have stop signs at the end of an on ramp...you know right at the merge point...smh.The worst is when they flip you off or honk, throw hands up etc when you have the nerve to not slam on your brakes to let them merge.  Keep up or shut up.This question must be posted by someone who lives where roads are constructed properly.  Merging at 30mph sound heavenly.

In the northeast near urban areas “merge” ramps are nothing more than a 30 foot section of road used to line up cars, sometimes with a stop sign directly to a highway.  Good luck!

Edit: my personal favorite is the Atlantic ave.    to 278 south ramp in Brooklyn.  It’s a short “ramp” that fits about 2 cars, with a stop at the end,  on a blind turn on a highway people are regularly going 65 on.  I lowered my windows to listen for traffic before I merged. #nycI feel like the real reason for a lot of people are suggested speed signs on ramps. They don't notice the sign doesn't say maximum and don't remember back to driving school where they would have been told those were mainly for semi trucks. So they think there's this speed limit while on the ramp and they can't speed up until they actually get on the highway.

 I find the same thing on off ramps for highways, a lot of people slam the brakes on when they reach the suggested speed sign rather than allowing the car to slow by just taking their foot off the accelerator.Man, I merge like I'm getting onto a racetrack. Usually going faster than traffic unless I'm stuck behind said asshole I used to be a Trooper on an interstate, whenever I saw someone stop in their lane of travel, put a car in reverse for a missed turn, or go -10 in the left lane it was an automatic ticket from me. No warnings or excuses, the only benefit I gave them was using the least point value or $ fee traffic citation (-1 point or $30). Hoping I was doing my part in making the roads safer for "you all that run into these critters"....but there's hoards of people out there that I can't comprehend how they survive day to day living seeing what they do or excuses i would get.

For the 30mph on-ramp drivers- my observation was they own the road mentality. Thinking it's the other persons fault for driving the speed limit and not reacting. or that the YEILD sign meant other driver shall yield to their decision... 
     One of my little joys to the job was morning shift, doing what was called "Checking the Interstate making sure it was still there" (no stranded motorists, hazards, signs/rails not damaged...) During this check I would pay special attention to the X-overs (authorized vehicle use only, Interstate U-turns). Everyday/night someone will try to use them at highways speed essentially making a 90 deg. left turn going 70 mph. The skidmarks going straight into the bushes/guardrail always made me smile. They always left without reporting the accident and a week later claim the car was stolen or vandalized due to the damage to insurance. Guess I got grumpy after working who know how many accidents resulting from the bad driver taking a X-over and then the good driver getting rear ended from slamming their brake to avoid them...Only one wreck was I able to chase down the guy that started these chain reactions by using an X-over...6 insurance companies then going after 1 company. No experience with them but his insurance company name was a military rank...I'm sure everyone had to pay out of pocket due to him
I want to know why some people are going an ok speed and then BRAKE like what are you hoping to accomplishMy mother in law stopped on the freeway once to look at a map.  Christ. Ugh, this is my Mom. She mostly tailgates flatbed semi-trucks because that SUV 150 yards back may be speeding! Nevermind that she's one brake check from a beheading, *they could be speeding back there!*Because those of us who can drive compensate for her idiotic and deadly decisions.>I don't know how she hasn't caused a wreck or twelve by now.

She probably has. On several occasions I've seen elderly drivers cause accidents and carry on blissfully unaware.My mom used to do this. She probably still does, but I haven’t been in a car with her driving since I got my license.

I remember once incident, where there wasn’t even a merge, the on ramp turned into a “new” lane on the highway. This was near our house, so she should have been familiar with this traffic pattern, as we had taken it about a million times, but today for some reason she thought it was in fact, a merge, and that traffic wasn’t going to let her in, so she stops. 

I hear screeching behind us... luckily the car directly in back of us was paying attention and he slides to a stop. Unluckily for him, however, (and what sounded like 2-3 more people... I heard: screeeeeeech *bang* screeeeeeeeeech *bang* screeeeech *bang*) not everyone was as on the ball. 

I look over at my Mom, and she is completely in ignorance of the wreckage behind us. And as she blissfully accelerates away, I swore I would get my license as soon as possible so as to never be in a car with her driving again. If I see a dude trying to merge in and I'm not too close to the on-ramp, I will usually merge to center or slow up to give the guy more room to get in at speed (and give a flick of the old high beams to say "Go ahead, chum.  I see you and I you are all clear").  But holy mother of balls, occasionally I get the guy merging in who will not fucking accelerate in.  Just the hesitant "should I go?  Ok, I'm gonna go.  You ok if I go?".  I'll be flipping my high beams like I'm trying to give my indicator an orgasm.   "GOOOOOOOOO!!!!!"4
People who panic that easily need to have their license suspended on the first offense. Second offense it needs to double in length. Third they don't need a license anymore. Sorry, your fear isn't worth causing people to have a wreck.

You can't be a coward when you're driving a death machine like a car. Much like you can't be a coward and have get a license to carry a gun. It's just asking for trouble and someone to get hurt.Dear God my mother does this. I remember driving with her, I was young but had been driving a few years. Going down a 2 lane back road at highway speed (55ish) following in line at least 4 long (I'm number 4).  No one is following anywhere remotely close but there is enough hill that you can see all the way to the lead car and he hits his brakes. Not a concern for me 4 cars back but my mother freaks the fuck out!  Screams and stomps the  imaginary brake on her side. WYF!  Scares the living shit out of me. She panicked that I was not also braking. Keep in mind too that neither of the other 2 cars needed to hit their brakes in this scenario either. She probably has but was oblivious to itMy wife rear ended a lady on her way to our wedding because the lady got off on the wrong exit and then whipped it across three lanes of traffic and then stopped in the middle of the highway. Bad thing is she stopped because that ended up being her exit and she was trying to get back to the exit ramp. Sounds like my mom. I drove her and my dad back home from a college tailgate and she was screaming the whole way cause she wasn’t used to seeing someone who can properly merge on a freeway That is the worst.  People who default to braking just because they are reacting to something, are the damn worst

I can't tell you how many accidents I've avoided by hitting the gas ITS A YIELD NOT A FUCKING STOP FFS! I hate people.....I see people do this all the time in Dallas.  They're white knuckling it because they shouldn't be on the freeway in the first place, but think they're smart because they're passing two lights on the feeder and exit half a mile down.  That's a much brighter perspective than most of us have of these peopleHad a friend do that once transporting a wedding cake across the state (300ish miles). She was savvy enough to put a big sign in her back window explaining this fact. Probably helped a lot.Or they learned to drive so that an open cup of soda won't fall over when placed on the floor. Before cup holders.I too make assumptions like this. Super aggressive driver? Well, he must have to poop. Or he's late for work. Or something. Everyone has their own reasons for their behaviour and if it's okay for me to be an asshole sometimes, well, it's okay for them to be an asshole sometimes. Besides, what difference does it make to me? (This is ignoring people driving unsafely, just dick ish driving)Sounds like yet another reason to avoid DC.Except the law says to accelerate to the rate of moving traffic on the highway while merging...I know because it's the only question I missed 12 years ago. Good job DC.Ramp 35, speed limit 55, traffic 75. Welcome to 395.What the fuck?  There is an actual speed limit on the ramp, that's lower than the highway?  Sounds like someone done fucked up, that's just retarded.where is this a thing? I've lived in the area my whole life and still do. There are a lot of speed cameras in and around DC for sure, but I'm not aware of any on the 395 on- or off-ramps. I speed quite a bit on 395 all the time haha and have never gotten a speeding camera ticketPlugging myself here, but you get [better mpg if you accelerate hard. Or at least don't feather the throttle.](https://reddit.com/r/cars/comments/718ob0/its_stupid_question_weds_ask_your_car_related/dn9snqa?context=3)Risking the lives of everyone around you to save a few cents on gas. Makes sense. That's why you use the entire on ramp to get up to speed.Alternately, I know the guy infront of me is going 60 now, but he WAS going 30 for most of the ramp, and my car does not accelerate as quickly as his!taking one for the team i seeThe exact same people who believe the only response to ANY unexpected event is to stand on their brakes as hard as possible and come to a complete stop in the middle of the road.

EDIT: Thanks for the gold, fellow frustrated driver. I'm loving all these stories. Read a study where the biggest factor in crashes wasn't speeding but differences in speed. Basically go with the flow of trafficI learned the same thing in driver's ed. When I started driving with my parents, they would freak out when I would accelerate to merge onto the highway. I told them that that is how they taught us. I don't think they used to teach it that way.Some places don't even require drivers ed courses to be taken. I see that as the same reason why these people not only insist on doing the speed limit and no more on the interstate, but they think there is no problem sitting in the fast lane either.

at the very least I'm glad that I have get to come across drivers who stop at the end of the on ramp waiting on an opening when it isn't bumper to bumper traffic. There's a reason an on ramp is also called an acceleration lane.My father-in-law subscribes to this school of thought. Always does 10 or more under regardless of the road. They came out to visit us in Illinois once and only once via the interstate. On parts of the interstate along the route if you're not going 10 or more over you're an obstruction. He went 15-20 under the entire time, slowing down even more when traffic got heavy. Every time we have to go somewhere with him we have to strategically plan it so that he's not driving. It's terrifying to have cars whipping past you at 30 mph faster constantly. The infuriating part being that it does not save gas.Tell her she'd save more gas by not driving at allWhat professional tells people to go slow on highway onramps?  Apparently not the professionals who should be professionals."Oh wow, those cars are going awfully fast... I better stop on the on-ramp until there aren't any more cars. That's the smartest and safest option."

GAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHI think a few lessons people have forgotten 

- how to merge and use shoulder

- how to stop at a stop sign without rolling into the street and how to roll through a yield without stopping.

- how to use blinkers

- how to use the passing laneGet slower until you hit zero, and then start going against the flow of traffic on the shoulder. It's the only way.Have fun with [this on-ramp](https://www.google.com/maps/@34.0941462,-118.2064685,3a,75y,123.78h,76.13t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1suWO_6SH3B6GTbYFL3-QWyw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656) (oldest freeway in LA). 

Edit: [Here's another one](https://www.google.com/maps/@34.1031531,-118.192555,3a,75y,60.5h,85.75t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1seTISxAKmVUxlVzHIFturkQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656)As much as I didn't like driving in L.A. my exit had a merge lane for a merge lane then a solid quarter mile before you actually got into the main traffic, which helped a lot with the idiots.This has to be the only true explanation. I wracked my brain for years wondering, turns out they just like feeling like they can do something scary.This is the right answer. Some people really don't understand speed differential.Taking the alternate route into the city should be exciting and dangerous!Massachusetts still has these? Pennsylvania used to have a bunch, but I haven't seen any in a few years (though I don't live there, so maybe I'm just missing them). A stop sign... ON the ramp? Can someone explain why this is?There are places on 93 that are literally designed to kill you (the on-ramp to 93 South in Dorchester near Umass comes to mind) I’m glad to hear cops actually ticket people for going too slow. Now if only they’d give more tickets to people who sit in the left lane because they feel like it. so many people tunnel vision and just don’t bother to look at their surroundings. plus, add in distracted drivers (from texting, calling, etc) and now you’re even more accident prone SpatialIMO driving tests need to include a performance component and a test of basic mental processing speed. If you can't keep up, get off the road. Sorry about your luck, but I don't want to die due to your sluggishness and incompetence. Whenever possible, i would change lanes to make it easier for traffic joining from the slip lane. I'd just like to say driving in Ireland and UK was one of the most pleasant experiences I've had driving. As a Texan, that means a lot because we have to drive quite often.I just leave my headlights on all the time even though they’re not automatic. I don’t remember the last time I drove and I didn’t go through at least one construction zone.I think in a lot of cases it’s “I can see fine.”  
  
It’s not so you can see, dumbass. It’s not even so people can see you from the front. It’s so people can see you through fogged up windows, reflected off rain-flecked, vibrating because they’re loose, passenger side mirrors. Why make them work for it?Just make the front of your car into two bright dots SO EVERYONE CAN SEE YOU NO MATTER WHAT, dumbass. I notice this more in cities where there is a high amount of street lights. I can only imagine that people don't realize that their headlights aren't on. Especially in rainy conditions for example, my head lights have no effect because they simply reflect off the road and I can't see that they're on. (I often repeatedly check as it makes me unable to see.)Headlights should always be on.  Even on the brightest day of the year, it increases visability.  There's no reason not to, plus the added bonus of being in the habit of turning your headlights on with your car so you're never the dangerous jerk with no lights on in the rain/dark.Turbo that Mirage baby!Ahh I think OP means 30mph right up until they need to merge, then they floor it in their 2020 Canyonero Turbo LTX with the 12.0 Liter V16 Diesel and instantly accelerate to plaid speed.

Meanwhile, you and I are trying to get the longest run up to the merge so we can build speed.....I have a Mirage, it can be difficult to keep up with other cars. I usually make a point of *not* being in the merging lane around on-ramps, as long as there's not a line of fast cars trying to pass at the same time.  Seems way safer to avoid the merging dance entirely than to trust that the merging driver is able to judge the situation properly.  Jeez, I do the opposite; I move left out of the right lane if I see a busy onramp ahead.

You'd think this is obvious shit, but common sense isn't very common on the roads.Yep, was looking for this one. It's just not possible to get all the way up to speed in my area, the on ramps are like 10 feet long and are also sometimes combined with exit ramps for some reason???You need to tell someone in your local government then.

There is a ramp I used to take every day that immediately turns into exit only 1/8th of a mile out. Everyone wants this lane to exit except the people in it. So you have to speed up, slam on your brakes for the guy who didn't signal or look. Then move over quickly and speed up.I've had this gem twice this month:  on ramp behind someone trying to merge & they hit the brakes when they ran out of lane because they're going so slow to begin with.  So now they're in the breakdown lane doing 15 mph trying again to merge.  Hello fellow Houstonian. "I hear you honking. And I also don't want me to be doing what I'm doing. I don't like that I am in that lane either, but I sure would like to get out of it." - John MulaneyThat's the answer to all frustrating traffic experiences. People are fucking stupid.At least you're honest :)¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯Same. Some of us are bad at driving... teach me?I hate short ramps. Where I'm living the ramps are at most 30 meters long and 90% of the time you come to a complete stop before you can merge. You basically drive towards them already anticipating a full stop, it's a big mess but I got used to it quickly. Then again the legal speed limit on this island is 60km/h (~37mph)Transport trucks are different. Everybody understands that they don't accelerate very fast. It's when silly Sally is driving her 200hp car down the on ramp at 40 km/h that people get mad.We are talking to people in jeeps, civics, SUVs, and the like, who have decent enough acceleration and speed to perform this. Semis get a pass, as they really can't help it. Listen buddy, it's ok because you have to shift through 12 gears trying to move, and you're the size of a house I can feel it and I know you'll be a bit slow so it's ok. 


But if you're doing 30 on the on-ramp to the highway in something capable of accelerating way faster than that, then you're being a douchebagEvery state has the worst drivers anywhere! And they're all from other states. ;-)As a Wisconsin driver, can concur ;)All bad driving boils down to a combination of incompotence, obliviousness, and narcissism.they're selfish and oblivious assholes who shouldn't have a license in many cases...This isn’t really a thing in California. There’s so many cars that every lane is full always. The far left lane is still usually a fast lane or carpool, but there’s too many cars to have a passing lane.If traffic is passing you on the right side, then you're in the wrong fucking lane. MOVE OVER!It’s truly sad how many people I pass on the right.Holy Cthulhu, when I was in Utah it was the worst. They have these carpool lanes and the damn soccer moms and elderly couples think "Hey, I have more than one person in my car, I'd better get in the carpool lane and drive 10 mph slower than anyone else".

It's a PRIVILEGE, not an *assignment*,  you bloody idiots. If you're going slower than everyone else get out of the way! The carpool lane is supposed to facilitate the flow of traffic, it's infuriating.My girlfriend and I live about 2 hours from hometown, and drive home fairly regularly. I typically drive because I have a more reliable vehicle, but one time she drove her car because we needed the extra space (she has a larger vehicle). She was only going 4-5 over, which is typically the flow of traffic, BUT SHE SAT IN THE LEFT LANE THE WHOLE FUCKING TIME. And then, she gets mad when people pass her on the right. I tried to explain to her that slower traffic keeps right, but she insisted that she wasn’t slower traffic because she was speeding. That’s not how that works. YOU are slower than THAT CAR, therefore get the fuck over. This is my answer. I'm flooring it while sending silent apologies to those poor souls trapped behind me. There's an on-ramp near where I live that is horribly designed. It's a 270 degree curve and foliage blocking the oncoming traffic until you're on a tiny little straightaway. It is literally impossible getting up to highway speeds on it. To make things worse, it's major freeway but goes down to 2 lanes in that area so big-rig trucks are always in the merging lane and they'll often be several in a row, and there's a cement barricade on the right hand side with very little shoulder. I've only nearly died a couple times. I understand on a curved one. But for straight ones. Then you just cause traffic jamsHEY IT'S NOT A PM BUT GREEN WITH LOW POLY BEARS You might be onto something here. I've always wanted those speed radar signs that say slowdown, if you're going too fast, put at on ramps but program them to say speed up... also sign that comes on in bumper traffic that says merge here. 
I have done this on occasion when some idiot on the highway keeps changing speeds trying to "help" me merge.  It's my job to adjust my speed.  Just go a steady fucking speed please.

But I suspect you are actually talking about people who panic and brake to a stop on the ramp.  I do not do that.I had this happen this past year, was driving on the highway and someone up and brought their minivan to a complete STOP in the middle of the damned lane bc they missed their exit.  When did people become so dumb, GPS autocorrects for your stupidity just continue on!My mother once got on the freeway *going the wrong direction*. Don't even ask me how.Why does she care if someone behind her is speeding?  I don't even understand this.To be fair most semi trailers (flatbed or box) have to meet new DOT regulations for the rear bumper that are there specifically to reduce the risk of underriding (and by deduction, decapitation) by a car from the rear.

Source: used to design semi trailers and was developing and testing a new bumper for one when I got laid off.I'm in Dallas and some of the on-ramps on the DNT are 12 feet long, so if the person doesn't accelerate in front of me I basically eat the wall.What the fuck dallas. The highway is 70mph and it felt like I was the only one doing the speed limit. Everyone was doing 60mph. Then dallas has these exits within an exit. So your GPS says take exit W but the exit is really named exit Y so you're like what the fuck? I don't miss this about Dallas. At all.Next time you want to flip somebody off on the road, give them a thumbs down instead. It's the "I'm not angry, I'm disappointed" of driving.  It changes your frame of reference from rage at how fucking dumb that guy was to an honest piece of feedback on their maneuver. That they drive like a constipated dog? But that would probably attract all of the sadists wanting to ruin somebody's dayBaby on board? Maybe don't take your rugrat on the freeway! Cake on board? Please proceed.I just assume they don't want to break the tofu.My car is 95, no cupholder. Why.thats how I learned to drift> Super aggressive driver? Well, he must have to poop.

*swerving through traffic, running people off the road* MOVE PEOPLE! THIS TURD **WAITS FOR NO ONE**Don't forget my favorite - his wife is probably having a baby.Giving people in traffic the benefit of the doubt will seriously de-stress your driving.Based on my experience in D.C., I'm surprised anyone is ever able to drive above 35 anyway because of the traffic.Revenue > public safety, every time, everywhere.I could see the government setting up speed-trap camera to catch your license plate as you accelerate down the ramp. You'll get a fine by mail 6 weeks later... and then realize you'll be receiving a new fine every day for the next 6 weeks for every other day you did the same thing in the interm.Ticket revenueI've always assumed ramps with speed limits are because the ramp curvature is too high for high speed. There are plenty of ramps in D.C. and Baltimore that would launch you into orbit if you tried to go highway speed on the curvy bit.

The problem is that the speed limit signs seem to imply that you should stay slow all the way through the merging process, which is ridiculous and is rightly ignored by 99% of people. But because it's unclear + number of crazy slow drivers, these already dangerous ramps with incredibly short merge lanes are doubly dangerous.I remember reading that you can calculate a driver's gas mileage VERY accurately solely based on how much they use the brakes -- not the gas. And that makes sense if you think about it for a second.After reading your linked comment, I agree with most of it, but strongly disagree with the high RPM part. 

Obviously you are correct about the efficiency stuff, which is why looking at BSFC maps is the right way to evaluate the best way to accelerate. You're also right on about the high torque, most BSFC maps show peak efficiency when torque is at around 80% of its maximum for that RPM. But BSFC maps also tend to show peak efficiency at about 2000 RPM. [A quick google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=bsfc+map&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjBxI33oN_XAhUrqlQKHc9qBtUQ_AUICigB&biw=1920&bih=949#imgrc=IzfAAi37hr1JcM:) produces a huge number of BSFC maps, as you can see at least 80% show peak efficiency between 1500-2500 RPM. In most cars 2000 RPM is going to mean unacceptably slow acceleration on an on ramp, but something like 2500 with high torque will probably be enough while still being close to maximum efficiency. 

Edit: After rereading your post, we may just be using different definitions of high RPM, I'm not sure. Quick note, while you are correct about BSFC maps, you need to consider that the end goal is not to arrive at a target speed.

It's to travel a given distance.  So while you are less efficient while feathering the gas pedal, you are still covering distance to your destination.  You need to consider the integral of speed (the distance) as the target.

You should be able to see this in most modelling fuel economy codes (EPA or commercial) by performing a backward kinematic analysis.  In this case, you impose a known drive cycle, and solve for the most ideal engine speed/load to arrive there.> better mpg if you accelerate hard. Or at least don't feather the throttle.

i'm a little suspicious about the claims made in the linked comment Makes cents"Here's a buck, dad. This trip's wide open throttle merges are on me."I hang way back the first half of the ramp so I have room to get up to speed even if the idiot in front of me won't.Me too! I work in proctology.saw a person stopped in the middle lane of the freeway with the turn signal on. "That's my exit - stop the world, I need to turn now"I once witnessed an accident where a woman had car trouble and stopped in the middle of the highway at 6:00 am on a weekday and called for help.  Needless to say someone slammed into the back of her.  I pulled over and luckily everyone was ok, but what really got me was after the initial accident, she pulled her car off onto the side.  So apparently it was working all along.  Let me also add that being on the side of the road with the injured woman waiting for help while cars and semi trucks screamed by and slammed on brakes while running over debris while still dark early in the morning was the scariest situation I've ever been in.That includes wet/icy roads.This. This could not be more accurate. Whenever im in the car with my dad (who swears hes a great driver because he drives slow and never gets tickets), I'm a nervous wreck because he does 50 in a 65 as people are flying by us doing 80. We almost got t-boned going down a small town road, and I see the guy and so I alert my dad and what does he do? He stands on the breaks lining us up directly with the car that's about to hit us. Didnt even bother doing evasive maneveurs.

I drive us whenever we go somewhere now."A car pulled over to the shoulder on the opposite side of the road? Let's slow down just in case!"Which is why I rear ended someone 2 years ago.  Granted, I made the mistake of assuming, having seen the brake lights, that the car wasn't coming to a complete stop on the interstate in medium traffic.  So I tried to not slam on my brakes so I wouldn't get rear ended.

But by the time I realized that the person was actually coming to a stop, I couldn't stop in time.  Legally, it was my fault, and in actuality it was partly my fault for making an assumption.  I still am a little sour though that it made my insurance go up.

Edit: Ever the hypocrite, while I get really annoyed with your/you're, I still can't do brake/break.
I actually had to do exactly this the other day.

The light had just turned green and a fire truck came thru going about 60 MPH without their siren or lights on.

I have never slammed my brakes that hard. I would absolutely be dead if I hadn’t. Can’t believe a fire truck, in a rush to save someone else’s life, would endanger other lives on the way to do so.Some guy pulled in front of me on the highway the other day and did this. He was on the shoulder right before a bridge, and the shoulder ended on the bridge. Pulled right out when I was not even 20 feet away. 

It wouldn't have made a difference if he stopped or went, because it was a fucking highway. BUT, HOW WAS YOUR INSTINCT TO SLAM ON THE BRAKES?! Literally the worst reaction. And why would you not wait for the cars moving at highway speeds to pass? You were parked in the shoulder. 

You almost fucking killed me dude. Thank god I was paying attention. I was so mad, and if you are reading this know that you did something very very dumb. My Dad takes incredible pride in his exhaustingly slow driving. When I was a kid we would be doing 45 on I-5 with people flying by us. On two lane highways long lines of cars would gather behind us. He was also extremely judgmental about people who drove faster thinking them all idiots.



I barely remember this but we were rear ended on I-5 in the middle of the night on a lonely stretch north of Sacramento by a semi. It was a hit and run. We all survived with bumps, bruises and scratches (pre seat belt usage, we were all thrown throughout interior and car drifted to the side with no driver) and in retrospect I wonder how much our truck’s unexpected appearance in the dark played into it. To a semi doing 70+ a car doing 45 would come up quick.Yep, things like driving slow in the left lane causes other (faster) drivers to weave and pass recklessly trying to get around and unpredictable driving patterns like that cause way more wrecks than everyone on the freeway driving smoothly at 80+mph. To OP's point, trying to merge when you're going 20mph slower than traffic you're merging with causes that traffic to have to brake or dive into other lanes to avoid you, and causes the people behind you to dive out around you into a lane where they can get up to speed quickly, sometimes without paying adequate attention to approaching traffic in the lane(s) they're diving into.This is one reason why I hope that self-driving cars can become a thing as quickly as possible. I am hoping for the driving utopia where we can all be on the freeway cruising along at ~120 mph, cars are safely spaced, merging works as it should, any possible accidents are communicated through the local driving network so there aren't any surprises when you come around a turn. I love the feeling of driving - especially driving a stick. But self-driving cars cannot come soon enough imo.Where I live if everybody is speeding except you, YOU can be the one to get ticketed. Yeah this is actually the exact reason why a bunch of states are passing left-lane laws. It's a $200 fine to hold up traffic in the left lane in Georgia even if traffic behind you is exceeding the speed limit, to take one example. Traffic incidents have gone down in the two years since the law was passed which certainly seems to suggest that speed differential was a bigger danger for accidents there.They've always taught it that way, your parents are just poor drivers. hello that would be pennsylvania. my high school didn't even *have* drivers edOklahoma recently passed a law preventing people from sitting in the fast lane.  It's the most refreshing thing. *passing lane> I see that as the same reason why these people not only insist on doing the speed limit and no more on the interstate


Change the law so a ticket for 15 Kmph *~10 miles over doesn't cost me $2000 over 5 years. Even if it did save gas for that 1 person, you're causing everyone on the highway to waste much more gas because they have to slow down then speed back up.I know, right? Engines are most efficient at wide-open-throttle. No restriction at the throttle gate so the engine isn't working against intake manifold vacuum.

The only time accelerating at wide open throttle is inefficient is if you're doing it needlessly, for example if you accelerate all the way up to 60MPH on a surface street just to have to slam on your brakes to stop at the next light.

If you're going to get up to 60-70MPH and stay there for a while, by all means accelerate as quickly as you safely can without losing traction.People do this in and around San Antonio Texas a lot. Its the weirdest thing. 200 miles to the east in Houston this is unheard of, but for some reason its a super localized regional thing. The first time I got stuck behind someone doing this I thought their car died on the on ramp, then it happened again, and again. Had me thinking what the fuck is wrong with this town??

Edit: I'm bad at judging distance between cities.


Edit 2: on mobile. 9 is close to the P. I have fat fingers.You're missing a very critical one:

- How to turn onto oncoming traffic without causing an accident

For this next one, all hope is lost:

- How to use a roundabout- How to find the fucking gas pedal.Just recently moved to SoCal. Whoever designed and approved these highway entrances needs to be tried for crimes against humanity. I have yet to see an on ramp with adequate space to safely merge.That's basically every merge in New England (without the stop sign). 200 feet to get up to 65 MPH is more than enough for anyone. It sucks how some people use the merge lane as a "I'ma cut in front of all these other people in traffic with me which in turns creates the traffic I'm trying to avoid!"Yup like i commute on a divided highway that is 60mph with lots of driveways and people pull on to the road like its a 40mph zone.Don't worry. There are still plenty of stop signs at the end of the on-ramps in PA. :)You should check out the Merritt parkway in Connecticut. Some on ramps are a car length long, some have stop signs. Some off ramps are a car length right before a complete 180 turn. It's a circus.There's no room to put an acceleration lane after the driver gets vision of the highway so a stop sign is used to prevent drivers from merging onto the highway blindly.Or special.The issue is, if the state is going to impose those regulations (based on logic and safety, I agree), unfortunately the state will also be responsible for public services that can help all the people that get kicked off the road maintain their mobility. The state doesn't have the resources to do this. 

How is grandma going to get to church or go to the store if she can't drive?

Again, I AGREE that it is not safe for grandma to be on the highway. However, I also see why the state is in no hurry to enforce these kinds of regulations.While it's not always possible it is a good courtesy move. Often times I feel more safe doing it if I can tell I'm moving much faster than the merger and people don't like to use their indicators here. You avoided the magic roundabout then?My car is a murky blue and disappears in almost all weather conditions so my lights are on pretty much all the time. In 1987 there was a factory turbo mirage. Had cool seats.Yes, this crap exactly. If you do manage to get around them, a minute later they go tearing by, phone in hand. Seriously. I avoid the right lane like a plague when I'm passing an on-ramp.Good luck if the ramp is uphill as well.I usually move over a lane so that merging traffic has plenty of room to merge. I feel like a lot of traffic issues could easily be resolved if drivers weren't ignorant assholes.

Also, some places love to put the on ramp before the off ramp, so then you get two different flows of traffic competing for the same tiny slice of real estate. Best thing to do if someone is that slow down the ramp is to back right off them and then give yourself space to accelerate into a gap after they've cleared out the way.  Depends on the junction as to whether there's room to do so or not and you can get some really funny reactions from those behind you but if you're merging into a busy fast moving road then the only safe way is to be merging at roughly the same speed as the traffic.You are correct!  Why, hello! "Cars were pulling up and looking over to see who just did that piece of shit move. Expecting to see like a hundred-year-old blind dog, who's texting while driving and drinking a smoothie. Instead they see a 28-year-old healthy man trying his best."/r/UnexpectedMulaneyAbout 2/3 are because people are stupid. 1/3 are because people are selfish.Honest isn't the word I'd use.Go faster  
  
/taught It's actually more dangerous for you and those around you not to get up to speed in this instance. You are trying to merge with vehicles going 20-30mph faster than you who will either have to take evasive action, brake or stop you from pulling out causing you to stop at the end of an on ramp and then having to attempt to enter the highway from a standing start.

Just put your foot down and get to at least 50 before you get near the merge or take additional lessons focused on this particular area of driving to improve your confidenceSally is a fucking speed demon!!!! Time for her to tap the brakes... a few dozen times!!!! God dammit Sally!!!!Dude, forget that; I often find myself stuck behind slow moving sports cars and performance cars that cost several multiples of my yearly salary.

Why the hell did you spend that much money on such a nice car if you're going to drive it like a Ford Tempo? Let's trade so that beautiful machine gets properly enjoyed.Also, semis are sort of the king of the road. I mean that in a "he's many times my size. He can have his space" sort of way. Bigger = more deadly and more deadly = healthy respect for your space.I'm willing to bet that it has more to do with population density than region. I hear a lot of people complain about "Indiana drivers" but they really mean "drivers on 94". Because 94 is forced upon people who live in the U.S. and are above it latitudinally and need to get somewhere on the other side of lake Michigan (but who dont drive through canada). Also happens in Wisconsin?In California the exit lane is the fastest due to everyone wanting to be In the fast lane. At least in SoCal. People are so funny. 

Edit. This really blew up and now I am concerned my lane is going to be more crowded now. Huge mistake. Sorry CA buddies. **VC 21461, failure to obey a properly posted roadsign** 

My favorite law. Ever see the sign *Slower Traffic Keep Right*? 

A CHP friend of mine prefers to write these over a speeding ticket.  Maybe in rush hour, sure.

But oblivious Californians are just as bad as those from any other state at fanning out to create a rolling roadblock during non-peak hours.And how many of them that were going 65 suddenly speed up to 75-80, just because you're trying to pass them? Idiots!!Okay, if some idiot is going 55 in the left lane with no one in front of him, of course im going to pass them on the right.

You're not supposed to, duh. But idiots aren't supposed to get licenses, or continue to have their licenses, and theyre sure as he'll not supposed to slow down 45 people and cause a jam far behind because they can't understand simple things like the fucking highway.

/rant.
But seriously, if you are getting passed on the right multiple times, and there's no one in front, MOVE OVER. You also cause accidents this way, and can get tickets for going too slow.

If your car cannot handle going 65+, stay in the right lane unless the traffic is only going under 65.As a Utah local, I apologize for our soccer moms and elderly. More often than not, one of them will block the carpool lane going 5-10 under the limit.Tell your city about itHouston has the opposite. We have traffic lights on the on ramps that cycle every 5 seconds to allow one car at a time, forcing all entering traffic to come to a complete stop at the bottom of a hill. It sounds like a good idea on paper during heavy traffic, but these lights are on every morning regardless of actual traffic conditions.My debate teacher in high school was driving us to a competition in a big ol van and missed her exit. It wasn't a big deal. This is one of the main highways in the Kansas City, KS suburbs and you can turn around easily at almost any exit. But she instead decides to THROW IT IN REVERSE in a 70 mph zone and back up about a half mile to our exit with one pair of wheels in the right lane and the other pair on the shoulder. We all had the look of people who had escaped death and the teacher acted like nothing out of the ordinary had taken place. I think the only reason we're still alive is the fact that it was the middle of the day on a weekday in a semi-rural area, so there wasn't much traffic. GPS has saved my sanity. Not everyone needs it, and not everyone can afford it, but hot damn I can never live without it again. I can absolutely read a map. The problem is, however, that I am one of those people who needs landmarks and reminders because I'm zoned out focusing on traffic and whatnot. 

I once drove an entire two hours out of my way because I was just following familiar landmarks, feeling smug about how I remembered the way, only to get to my destination and remember I wasn't GOING THERE, I was going somewhere else. I had to get out my map and figure out a way to get back to this back road in the country where I was supposed to be at my family reunion, avoiding construction and detours not on the map. This was before I had a cell phone, so everyone thought I was dead.

I also hail from small town Midwest USA and have massive anxiety, so I don't drive well in "regular" traffic, let alone actual heavy traffic. For that I just have to read a book in the passenger seat and pretend none of it is happening. Driving alone in Chicago was only possible because we'd just gotten a GPS and I didn't have to worry about reading the map and managing traffic and finding the address of the hotel I was going to. 

But the absolute best realization I've ever had probably stemmed from that 2 hour detour. **It's okay to miss your turn.** *It's not like you're now on a road to Canada with no exits.* Sure you might be a little late, but it's okay. You'll get there. Don't panic and drive stupidly, just keep going and be safe. Find the next turn and get out a map. Or if you're lucky, just let the GPS cuss you out and fix the route. 

Edit: Thanks for the gold, you generous stranger! I honestly thought this would get buried and like maybe 2 upvotes. I'm glad to know I'm not alone in my driving anxiety!  

--Also. I'm super sorry about my offhand Canada comment, y'all. I live smack dab in the middle of the US and rarely travel to the borders, so it's literally over 700 miles to escape North, and 1,300 miles to escape South. 2,000 to get out of here by boat to the Pacific, and 1,000 to the Atlantic (Please don't dox me). My personal biggest worry is a toll road with too few exits.  I apologize to those of you who've accidentally left your country. Also for possibly insulting Canadians. You are majestic. Please adopt me. I can kinda see that happening to anyone if the ramps are poorly marked and poorly arrangedI think the point he was making is that she wouldn't switch lanes to pass the truck due to fear of a distant car in that lane making up ground really quickly.I asked her. She thinks it means they could catch up to her and she's assuming they're gonna ram her car Fury Road style if they do. They always catch up but I have yet to witness a single flame throwing guitar or "Witness me!"

She also thinks the dark at 4:00am is different from the dark at 2:00am. No, not "it's more dangerous crime-wise" but "I can't see at 2 but I can see at 4...it must be darker at 2." She's full of these idiotic beliefs.Ahh dont worry.  The widening will be complete for your grandchildren's commute.EVERY DAMN DAY
Exactly! This is my every morning brush with death. Also, what I wouldn't give to be going 30 when I merge into rush hour DNT. Dallasite, reporting in. 

I'm considering installing Speed Racer's jump-pack on my car so I can hop over those fools. Also Dallas. Why the fuck are the DNT > 635 on and off ramps the same ramp? In what world does that make sense/not cause death and mayhem?I love living in Dallas, but would much rather drive in Boston. DFW is Southern California highway planning on drugsI drove to Dallas from Denton once. ONCE.Best idea I’ve seen in a while. I’m going thumbs. I'll pull up alongside them, look over for them to make eye contact.  The moment they do, I shake my head vigorously at them, like a disappointed parent.


Does it change their behaviour? Fuck no. But hopefully it makes them feel bad about what they've done. Well, I guess there is no avoiding that, no matter what you do!That's why you need to drift onto the freeway. In the 90's, people steered their car with one hand and held their beer with the other. Now that we have smart phones, we need somewhere to set our beer so we can text.Ever gone to your aunt's house 3 hours away for BBQ? No? Than DON'T FUCKING JUDGE ME!DC Traffic is seriously some of the worst in the nation. The ENTIRE metropolitan area is bumper to bumper between 3-7 PM every single day on every highway. It's just no fun at all

Edit: Guys I really don't care if "I should see x cities traffic" I said DC is "some of the worst" I did not say it was the worst because I have no evidence to back that statement up. It is some of the worst because it is the worst I have ever experienced, and I deal with it daily. Don't move hereby 11pm traffic is usually moving 55 (unless its the sunday of a holiday weekend).I got stuck in a traffic jam in DC at goddamn 2:30 AM! 2:30 AM! how is there a traffic jam at that hour!?The intent is to provide drivers with a sense of pride and accomplishment for slowing down before a highway. 💰💰And we're also the ones who paid for the equipment to ticket us - brilliant!This is one of my driving mantras - Brake as little as possible; every time you brake you are wasting gas. The energy you spent to speed up is sent into your brakes instead of moving you forward.Yeah, I try to leave myself lots of room ahead. When traffic in front of me slows down, I can often coast down until things pick back up, so I don't have to hit the brakes. Never checked to see if it helps my mileage, but it definitely helps my sanity while driving on the freeway. This is a necessary strategy in Michigan (and most places).Yup driving a 4 cylinder civic I have to do this all the time. Your Lexus may be able to go form 30 to highway speed instantly, but my 15 year old civic can't. Yup. First half of the ramp is your chance to create a buffer to protect yourself from people in front who don't know how to merge.You must be the bloke coming up behind /u/MrCda thenIf a person misses their exit it is their duty to continue on and take the next one. No swerving. No stopping. No needless endangering of lives. I've done it myself. There’s a Netflix original about people who listen to police scanners and try to get video, I want to say it’s called Shot In The Dark, but I’m not 100% on the name. 

Towards the end of the first episode there’s a guy who stops in the middle of the freeway and turns off all his lights. He gets clipped on the side, doesn’t move. Then a few moments later he gets hit by a truck. His vehicle goes flying and hits the cement barrier and explodes into a flaming wreck. 

Fuck people who stop on the freeway. Then there was the fatal crash in Quebec a few years back, where a woman had stopped in the left lane of the highway and got out to help ducklings:

Edit: Link with more details:
http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/appeal-court-is-expected-to-hear-case-of-woman-who-stopped-on-highway-to-rescue-ducklings
I'm teaching my daughter how to drive and we live in Alaska. I spend a lot of time taking about scenarios and "what would you do?" to get her to think about things ahead of time so that if the situation arises she has a plan other than "hit the brakes."

A couple weeks ago I had my own situation where I've was approaching a traffic light on a slight downhill with snow packed roads. I hit the brakes and started to slide, with a car stopped at the light in front of me. I looked at the cement curb, thought "oh crap" and steered into it. Damaged my wheel, but I didn't hit the guy in front of me. And I needed to get my alignment checked anyway, after summer construction.Ah, yes, when stamping on the brakes actually accelerates your car. 

Those people are the reason ABS had to be invented in the first place.My mom becomes increasingly more timid as she gets older and puts us in situations exactly like what you describe. So yeah, I drive us now too. Does your Dad complain about your driving the whole way? Does he constantly tell you how he would do something? Does he yell at you to do things his way?jesus christ this is literally my dad.

OH SHIT BETTER STAND ON THE BRAKES TILL THEY'RE FUSED TO THE ROTORS

when the better response is to floor it.....and that is how I learned how to drift a 3/4th ton truck *and* avoid being tboned."An ambulance doing 60 mph on the opposite side of a divided highway with a concrete retaining wall between us? OMG I MUST STOP IN THE FAST LANE RIGHT NOW!"Bad decisions by those types of drivers cause a lot of accidents. I almost rear ended a guy who got in the fast lane for EZpass and decided he needed to back up so he could go an pay the toll.  Note this fast lane is the one that doesn't even require slowing down so he's going backwards in a lane where everyone else is going 65+. It was everything I could do to stop. Then I have to worry about someone plowing into me. When traffic was finally clear enough for me to go around (he REALLY had to pay this toll I guess) I pulled out around him and looked over and he just smiled and shrugged like a apology... Completely oblivious that he could have killed people and his family. 

Tldr... Cars on the freeway go fast. Oblivious person tried to go in reverse on freeway but thankfully didn't get anyone killed. They are required by law to go slow through intersections on reds, if they fly through and hit someone, they are at fault.They're not supposed to; they are supposed to slow down when approaching a light. A friend of my mom's lost her husband to a speeding, silent fire truck when I was very little. I don't remember the details, but I do know she sued . . . someone?. . . and got a bunch of money, because he had no way of knowing that a goddamn speeding fire truck was coming his way.Depending on where you are on I-5, doing 45mph is half the speed as every other car is doing.

On some stretches of I-5 if you're going a double digit speed you're the *slow* car. Its 400 miles of perfectly flat road with farms and orchards as far as the eye can see. Visibility is to the horizon.Sounds like your dad is the one that's an idiot. He puts everyone in danger driving like that.> My Dad takes incredible pride in his exhaustingly slow driving. When I was a kid we would be doing 45 on I-5 with people flying by us. On two lane highways long lines of cars would gather behind us. He was also extremely judgmental about people who drove faster thinking them all idiots. 

This reminds me of a joke:

Wife (on the phone): Be careful, they said on TV there's a guy driving on the wrong side of the freeway.

Husband: It's not one guy, they're ALL driving on the wrong side!Yes and no, the speed issue is not as relevant for example on the Autobahn in Germany because everyone there stays to the right and respects the road. Here in the US I feel that people have no respect for the road, you have people in the fast lane on a 65 mph road who are going 60 and meanwhile you are trying to pass to resume your 70-75 mph cruising but cannot because you are blocked on both sides. 
If only people accepted that computers would be able to drive way better than them… Really you just need to get rid of two types of people and traffic jams would not exist:

1) Idiots who dart between lanes, tailgate, and are basically either slamming on their breaks or the gas whenever there is any amount of slowdown

2) Idiots who do the speed limit in the left lane

1% of the people cause 98% of the problems.Where I live, if everybody is speeding except you, YOU can be the one to get ticketed, but also, if everyone is speeding and so are you, YOU can still get a ticket. I was not taught that in Driver's Ed.  I just wasn't stupid.

My Driver's Ed course focused heavily on two things: speed kills, and if you're under a certain height you should get an airbag cutoff switch because they are more dangerous for very short people.

The speed kills thing was huge, and they did almost nothing but drill into our heads that it was always safer to go slower no matter what.  The airbag thing was because the teacher was under 5 feet himself and it was apparently a big issue for him.

The quality of many Drivers Ed classes is severely lacking.  I wouldn't be shocked if his parents really were taught to slow don on ramps.Moved to PA a few years ago. Everything makes sense now.Only problem with that is enforcement. Many states have that law, but cops don’t pull people over for it. *passing lane

Gotta get that perception to change along with the lawIt's weird when everyone is going 10 over though. You can go with the flow and risk a ticket on go slower and put you at a higher risk of an accident.

It's just like the law to not make sense.like they give a fuck about everyone else lolthe yield signs on the feeder roads being treated like stop signs.... GRRR.  San Antonio drivers don't know how to merge, but they are awfully pleasant otherwise.Only 9?Not gonna lie man I'm from Houston and when I was just starting out driving I did this. Not full stopped but I was going way too slow and realized after the person behind me almost hit me how bad I was fucking up.Every time we reach a roundabout I have to talk my wife through the roundabout. My biggest pet peeve while driving. I get so damn annoyed when I'm behind someone at a stop light and when it turns green they take their foot off the brake, but can't seem to understand that they need to actually press on the gas pedal to go more than 10 mph.These ramps were built when the top speeds of cars maxed out at 40. Its easy to understand why these are that way when you look at it from that perspective. Yep just add in limited lines of sight and some mountains and you have damn near every interstate merge in Pennsylvania that isn’t on the turnpike. Except they use a yield instead of a stop sign.Yup, we still have some on the parkways in Pittsburgh. A real pain in the assThat highway....it's fucking scary. And I'm from Boston and drive on route 2 and storrow drive where a lane just sort of turns into parked cars at some unmarked point. The answer is obviously a completely separate infrastructure called "death lanes" that these people can still use if they need toI don't think that's how it works at all.  The DMV isn't focused on making sure Public Transporation doesn't get inundated with too many riders.  That's an entirely different department.  In fact, if the DMV would take a much harder stance on who was allowed to drive, then you'd have all of these people with no means of transporation raging at their legislators to address the public transporation issues in their towns.> How is grandma going to get to church or go to the store if she **can't drive**

Fuck I don't know, but allowing her to drive even though she can't doesn't seem to be the right approach.Oh, man. I fucking LOVE roundabouts. If there were a country that had an entire transportation infrastructure made up of nothing *but* roundabouts, I would happily move there. Driving those roundabouts at speed made me feel like Mario fucking Andretti. Plus, they are so much safer. 

Do you know how much less likely it is to get T-boned by a cell phone-distracted driver when all the vehicles are going in the same direction, basically? I'll take some minor body damage over the kind of harrowing shit I see at four-way stoplights any day of the week.

Can you appreciate how relaxing it is to know that if you miss your turn you essentially don't have to do a damn thing except keep driving and you'll get another chance? 

Can you possibly even understand the unbridled joy a person who spends hours in stop-and-go traffic every week has when they realize it's been awhile since they last had to brake to a full stop?

Roundabouts are fucking magic, mate.Once had a car who's paint color was "primer". Was driving aorund with my friend on a rainy day and she asked why my headlights were on. I told her "grey sky, grey road, grey car, bad combo."Spotted the Houstonian right away...they don't call it "feeder" pretty much anywhere else! Human history abridgedIt's a perfectly cromulent word.Paint it REEEEEDDDDDD! /Woke I live in AR right now, which doesn't have mandatory drivers training.  I'd say about 60% of people don't even begin to grasp the concept of acceleration lanes.  So, the entire interstate slows down to 30mph at each onramp, in anticipation.  It's incredibly awful.Also a semi driver is obviously working.  Those trucks cost money to run, man!  I hate it when other people are rude to me at my job, why shouldn't that extend to those who have road-offices?Pretty sure you mean Indiana drivers :)  Unless us Indians are truly fucking up your day, in which case, I apologize on behalfNah. We just hate FIBsCalifornia has the best worst drivers in the worldBuy him a beer for meAnd then you pass them again. Then they speed up and pass you, and you pass them, and you two keep passing each other over and over agian.

Meanwhile, you know the other guy is a fucking idiot because you've been in the same lane with your cruise control set for the last 20 miles.Those lights should only be active when the traffic on the highway is so dense that it's not moving at full speed.

If they're active during normal full highway speed conditions, they're not implemented properly.You must live in the middle of nowhere... Where I am , if you even slow down by 5 mph suddenly, someone is likely to slam into the back of you, let alone stopping or reversing...>not everyone can afford it

old units sell for like $5 at garage sales in richer neighborhoods... besides, even a $50 unit is next to no additional cost of operating a vehicle.How can someone afford themselves a car but not afford a GPS? Not to mention that it's built into every smartphone today.Every fucking ramp of the FL turnpike. The most retarded over complicated ramps ever.

You're in the middle of nowhere and they still make them with the super big stupid loop as if they were in the middle of the city and that was the only way. 

Then they put the "wrong way" signs in between the roads so when you join the correct ramp you still freak out thinking you're doing it wrong.

Seriously I don't get what they were trying to accomplishYou should tell her about the gas pedal. It's great for gaining speed. If you're afraid of a distant car making up ground quickly, round robin watch your distance ahead and the car in the distance. If it looks like it'll take several seconds for the car in the distance to reach you, feel free to move over and speed up. 

You need max 3 seconds of observing and analysis to know for certain it's safe to pass.> She also thinks the dark at 4:00am is different from the dark at 2:00am. No, not "it's more dangerous crime-wise" but "I can't see at 2 but I can see at 4...it must be darker at 2." She's full of these idiotic beliefs.

This is just incredible.  We need to isolate and study people like this.oh did they get to expedite the process? Original estimate was great-great grandchildrenFuck absolutely everything about Dallas traffic.  Hard.  In the ass.That implies that there **WAS** planning.Been driving Dallas to Denton at least once a week for the last five years with no incidents. Pretty confident I can drive anywhere now.That's really all it takes.I wiggle my pinkie at them. Fist closed, pinkie up and flicking about. It doesn't mean anything, they can read into it want they want. Some people laugh, some people do nothing,  but it tends to piss off the bro dozer types.I give thumbs down on the first offense (this happened recently), the second offense gets two thumbs down (I get this isn't entirely safe, but it gets a point across), the third offense got the Ford f150 raptor (I have a tiny dick and a lot of money) edition a middle finger, and the fourth got him the double middle finger dance. Thanks for cutting me off four times in half a mile because you couldn't decide which lane you wanted to be in.
Sincerely,
Go fuck yourself.Careful with the thumbs down, people hate it because it draws attention to them, not you, like flipping the bird out the window does...i have been flipped off and actually chased by people after i give them the thumbs down, they hate it, I love it.Hey. Once, I was driving and threw my cigarette butt out the window. An old lady pulled up by me, slowed down, made eye contact. And shook her head at me for what felt like a lifetime. I pulled right into the auto parts store shit near me and bought a newfangled ashtray for my car (...that doesn't have ashtrays. Thanks very much!). Anyways, I've since quit smoking, but I credit that one old woman for the reason why I ride everyone else's ass about cigarette butts. She stared into my soul, dude. She guilted me for a lifetime. I still feel guilty when I see butts on the ground and I don't even smoke anymore. Keep it up, if you got that staredown thing down.. &nbsp; 

Edit. Syntax. Ew.Nani? Dorifuto o māji suru?Lol that's still mexico. According to the people I work with, the Mexican cops don't care if you drive drunk because 90% of the time they've got a Corona in one hand behind the wheelI get to take I-66 Monday thru Friday to almost every site I work at. Somedays, I get to take I-66, 495, 395, and 95 all in one day. On my drives, I wonder, "Why do people live here?" Then I wonder, "Why do I live here?!"If you rank worst traffic, DC is number one, which is better than you can say for our sports teams. At least we win at something, I guess. By 11PM the cops are fishing for crazy kids racing at 100mph+ so they don't even care that there's a steady stream of cars going 75mph+ in the left lane.Holy fucking hell EA fucked up hard on that.I tried to tell the officer that after I blew through the red light this week, but he wasn't having any of it.Exactly! And this is precisely the method/reasoning by which hybrid vehicles like the Prius achieve better mileage.  

They use "regenrative braking", which means that some of the energy you would lose when braking is converted back into stored energy to use at a later point.> This is one of my driving mantras - Brake as little as possible

Drives me up a fucking wall when people are braking downhill, too. Then they're not going fast enough when they get to the bottom. The fuck is wrong with people....But why casually roll forward at 5-10 mph in heavy traffic when you could be doing GOSTOP GOSTOP GOSTOP GOSTOP GOSTOP?

Obviously the GOSTOP method gets you there quicker!Thank you so much for being that person! This is how you "fix" most traffic jams as they're usually caused by a few people that hit the brakes too hard 20 minutes ago in that same spot.

Definitely doing yourself a favor with mileage too.Someone has a 7th gen Civic still. Honda engines are fine for higher RPM operation. Don't be afraid to wind it to the red. And change your oil when you're supposed to.I got an 06 manual. That thing ain’t bad when you really need the acceleration.I saw a motherfucker actually put his car in reverse on the highway to get to his missed exitOnce when I was driving down the highway the guy in front of me missed the exit, and instead of continuing on to the next one, proceeded to reverse down the highway, over the grass median, and pop out onto the exit ramp *inches* in front of me. I was 99.9% pissed as all hell but gotta admit the other 0.1% of me was really impressed. What's great about Texas is that highways all have frontage roads - if you miss an exit, you don't have to completely recalculate the route to get where you meant. Just follow the frontage road. Anyone who stops their vehicle in a travel lane and turns off all lights (for any reason) is a deserving Darwin award candidate. It's just too bad when their recklessness causes an innocent person to get hurt.>summer construction

There are really only two seasons in places it snows, Winter and Construction.I firmly believe r/roadcam should be taught in driver’s ed. Im still glad ABS exists To be fair, brakes always accelerate the car in one way or another.Don't diss on ABS like thatMy mother as well.   I've never known true fear until riding on a highway too sick to drive us myself and shes going 45 in a 60 zone.   She wont even park in our driveway because its on a slight incline and shes too afraid to get her short car in. I have to meet her two streets over. smh. > oh its so nice to go out now, I don't know why, but everybody else always wants to drive!

-my momMy mother is definitely *not* self aware about how much her driving habits and skills have declined. She’s “only” 60 but already does things like merge onto the highway far below speed, hesitates to the point she causes confusion for other drivers and causes dangerous situations and she also refuses to change lanes with in reasonable distances which means she’s merging far too early or if it’s not early enough for her she simply will not do it missing her exit/turn - thankfully she has embraced GPS at the very least. Even situations she was comfortable with before she cannot navigate anymore with out constant fear and anxiety. Her husband is far worse, and even less self aware, constantly speeding up just to stomp the breaks... I don’t get car sick ever but he gets me pretty close on top of making me terrified. Honestly there should be mandatory retesting as you age.  If you don't feel safe driving normally you're probably not safe driving at all.  It's way too easy to kill someone in a car to wait for them to get in an accident before their license is taken.My mom did, constantly. That is, untill I had a mental breakdown from it in my car. I started punching and slapping my steering wheel screaming on the top of my lungs: THIS IS MY GODDAMN CAR AND I WILL DRIVE IT AS I SEE FIT, AAAAAAAAH! She never complained again. 

Edit: Well my inbox just exploded with both positive and negative replies. Just to clarify, I respect my parents but enough is enough. Also I was 19 with my testosteron going apeshit at the time, cut me some slack. Is OP's dad my ex? If so, definitelyOh, try driving an ambulance with the lights and sirens on. It's like Mad MaxI know it varies from highway to highway but I recently missed the toll booth when getting on one as my GPS decided to send me around the booth into the EZPass lane. It was about 1am and I considered this exact manuver but decided against it. Had to pay just over $50 for a missing ticket. However the attendant gave me a form to fill out and send back. I sent it in with an explanation and the ticket stub from the car park I used in the city which had my car's plate on it as evidence of which plaza I got on at. It took about a month but I was refunded my money, minus the regular toll for the trip.

Guess the guy didn't know about what would happen if he missed the toll.Also siren must be on for them to be exempt from regular traffic laws>Visibility is to the horizon.

approximately 3 miles or ~~4.5~~2  minutes at 90 mph.Don't forget about the constant danger of big rigs that suddenly decide they need to pass one another at approximately 1mph faster than the one in front of them....And there's some asshole CHP officer hiding behind a bush, making sure you're not going a blip over 65 mph on that deserted road. Meanwhile, he'll be dusting off at 95 when his shift is over. Oh man the worse was a trip through Baja. He refused yo pull over for people behind him saying "this is how fast they should be going anyway." The result was people would pass us in terrifying ways on the windy mountainous road we were on. That trip was actually the last time I've done a long road trip with him.My mom feels there is no need to drive above 60 mph so she goes 60 on a 65 and doesn’t care. It makes me so mad. Wait about 40 years and most of the people that think that will be too old to drive or dead.So your driver's ed course didn't focus on how to drive...Thank you! It’s for passing slower traffic on the right, not sitting 2” off the rear bumper of the car that’s already flying by cars in the right lane. I’ll get over when there’s an opening, but I don’t need someone trying to fucking kill me in the meantime. 

Also, if there’s literally a mile of cars and trucks backed up in front of me in the left lane, you can chill the fuck out and back off. There’s nowhere to go. San Antonio roads are a recipe for failure to begin with, and I don't think I've ever seen the loop NOT under construction in 15 years.


That said, San Antonio drivers aren't actually "San Antonio drivers", they're 80% country bumpkins from Buttfuck Nowhere (population 50) passing through/ trying to get to the airport.Yes! I moved to San Antonio six years ago and almost hit the person in front of me when they stopped completely for a yield while there was no traffic. 

I figured it was just how Texans drove until I drove through Houston and Corpus Christie. Nope San Antonio drivers just do it. God Forbid a 10th person does thisSounds like you guys are into some kinky shit. I like it. i don't get how this keeps happening it's literally a circle-shaped road with yieldsWhat is hard to manage about a roundabout?

I really don't understand the confusion. You just go the direction of traffic until you get to the exit you want. It's like literally every other road, just a touch more curved. They even paint lines on it (again, like literally every other road) and all you have to do is keep your car in the lines.Every time I reach a roundabout I briefly become religious and quickly become an atheist again after exiting. I like to hedge my bets.The parkway as a whole is a pain in the ass. Nothing about it makes sense. 666 isn't the mark of the beast, 376 is.That part of mem drive westbound right by Harvard too, right lane is just parked cars. All the parkways suck.No, they’d just bitch at the DMV to lower the standards.I think he might be referencing this bastard of a design for people that haven't been on it before.

Fucking Illinois Shitheads Towing a Boat.I live in California and my three biggest driving pet peeves are: going the speed limit in the left lane, going under the 55 truck speed limit in the slow lane(causing the trucks to move to the middle and the middle slow people unto the fast lane), getting on the freeway under the speed limit.

Bonus 4th: if I am going down the road and you pull in front of me from a side street and it causes me to hit the brakes. Bonus points if there is FUCKING LITERALLY NO ONE BEHIND ME FOR FUCKING MILES. Double Bonus if you drive 10 under the limit after you've pulled in front of me.I’m convinced that California has such strict gun laws because of their drivers. I think you would all shoot each otherwise. Exactly, holy fuck.  I just assume those people don't have cruise control. Kansas is pretty much the definition of the middle of no where.Yep and cheap Android phones are like $30 and I'm sure even they have GPS. I think the same people that are stopping in the middle of an on ramp are the same older people that don’t even know that GPS is an option.  My mom has an iPhone, but she doesn’t know how to use anything on it unless I explain it 100 times. Accomplish? Sir, this here is Florida. We are surrounded on three sides by water. Our average land height is below sea level. This causes the entire state to suffer through 90% humidity levels on our best day. Our national bird is the mosquito. We have panthers, alligators, boars, bears, and our very own version of sasquatch. The only thing we try to "accomplish" is surviving being outside just long enough to finish whatever hellish demands our superiors place on us so that we can then retreat back inside to our beloved central air. Trust me those signs are quickly placed wherever the hell we can safely stop at any given moment.> Then they put the "wrong way" signs in between the roads so when you join the correct ramp you still freak out thinking you're doing it wrong.

This..this I have seen way too often. > Then they put the "wrong way" signs in between the roads so when you join the correct ramp you still freak out thinking you're doing it wrong.

I don't know what roads you're talking about but this ^ exact thing scared the shit out of me driving in a new city and I hit the brakes on the on-ramp, and got honked at for what looked like my extreme stupidity. Thankfully did not cause an accident. Christ it gave me a heart attack though.

It gets even better when it's raining. Oh, I know...I'll turn on my hazards in a monsoon! I see you've never driven a 1.3L 2000 automatic Suzuki Swift.Don't worry.

Absolutely. You're like a Colonel of driving. My Driver's Ed teacher told me "If you can drive in Texas, you can drive anywhere."Oh no, it means something alright :

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hWxU_ICoHMMy exgf used to place her cigarette butts back into the pack. Why? Because she had a dream one night that she died, went to heaven, but before being let in she had to go pick up all the butts she had dropped in her lifetime.I66 is dreadful, but I find 495 and 270 to be the worst during rush hourI moved away from Vienna, VA 2.5 years ago and now live in Los Angeles. Traffic here seems like a breeze compared to the DC areaIf you are in the DC area and not going at least 10 over the speed limit you are going too slowWell he's not gonna believe your theory if you stop all the way down for him. Next time make him follow you all the way home to really show case those sweet mpgs.For anyone that runs a close red and gets pulled over by a cop this is what you should say

"I didn't feel that I could safely stop before the intersection" has worked for me a couple of times. (It was true)

It combines responsibility and saftey into a single responseHuge "anti -braker" here. If people would leave a little cushion between them and car in front of them we wouldn't have this non stop accordion stop and go traffic. So it pains me to say that I discovered my car applied brakes on cruise control when it goes over the speed setting.  

i'm the 'eh, whatever' loaf along  with a gap opening and closing between me and the car ahead of me kinda heavy traffic driver. it's less stress, easier on my car, better mileage, etc...

but oh man the number of times i've seen people absolutely losing their shit in the rear view mirror because THERE'S A GAP WHAT THE FUCK IS THERE A GAP FOR GET UP ON THAT GUYS ASS OMFG YOU'RE DRIVING TOO SLOW SOMEONE IS GOING TO GET IN THE GAP AND GET TO THE END OF THE TRAFFIC THREE SECONDS BEFORE US!

this comment is always good for such a wave of self-righteousness. I think people that drive like this are literally only looking at the car ahead of them.  So many people should NOT be driving.  I can't wait till automatic driving cars are the norm.  I live in Seattle so I deal with this traffic, and holy fuck even if it actually *did* get you anywhere faster its just too goddamn stressful. I'll be easier on my MPG, brakes, and sanity tyvmIt's so frustrating when you actually apply this principal to real life.  People behind you will fucking rage that you're not speeding up to get onto the bumper behind you and stopping.  "GOD DAMN IT!  LOOK AT ALL OF THAT FREE SPACE IN FRONT OF YOU!  WE COULD FIT LIKE 7 CARS THERE BUMPER TO BUMPER, MOTHER FUCKER!"The worst is when people keep getting into that gap and screwing it up.I started doing this a long time ago as a favor to all the people behind me, because it's legitimately easier to drive in. My favorite is when I coast at a casual 5 for miles and the guy behind me keeps hitting 10 then slamming his brakes, as though he had no idea that I wasn't accelerating with him.

Also, if you're on a curvy stretch of highway, you can often look forward and see the exact individual causing you traffic problems.I drive an 08 civic... By the thousand rpm it goes dickless, dickless, dickless, dickless, oh it's trying, HEY YOU LEFT SOME ACCELERATION HERE LET ME PICK THAT UP FOR YOUI saw that same thing Saturday night on I-96 near Grand Rapids, MI. At least he pulled over to the shoulder before backing up. My grandma lost her license when she did a u turn on the highway because she missed her exit and got hit by a truck. She wasn't even that old at the time.Sadly, this happens somewhat frequently in Rhode Island...I saw a (foreign) family in a rental car stop on a bridge near Niagara falls to take a photo.  I changed lanes quickly to avoid them.  The guy behind me, tailgating me, plowed right into them.

Not sure who was at fault.  Parking on an interstate highway is obviously wrong, but hard to feel sorry for the tailgater, either, as he was on my ass for like 20 miles and refused to pass for some reason.

Idiot.Here in Denver we get all four seasons in a day but all seasons include construction.Dude you have no idea....construction season in Alaska fucking *blows* it's almost worse than driving in the winter.  Downtown Anchorage in the middle of January is scary as hell though, lanes don't exist, shit one way streets are very dangerous too because people don't realize they're one way.Me too. Otherwise I wouldn't be able to move my torso very well.As someone who learned to drive on a 60s farm truck it is an excellent invention that people take for granted. Unless you already stoppedMy parents made my Nana take a test when he learned about a couple fender-benders she'd been in. This was the only way she was going to give up her license. She failed so bad they didn't even do most of the test. Mandatory retesting as we age should definitely be a thing, and the infrastructure to get around without a car should be a priority. She was a danger to everyone on the road. That’ll probably do it.I had a (thankfully, now ex) girlfriend that was the worst backseat driver in existence. When we would go somewhere and I didn't know where it was, she would give the strangest directions (she'd tap her window if you were supposed to turn right, and there was something else for a left turn but I don't remember what it was now), and get really angry if I didn't catch them. Like start yelling that I don't listen to her. Would critique every single thing I did, too fast, too slow, wrong lane (not that I was in the wrong lane, but if there were multiple lanes, whichever one I was in was the wrong one). All this, she didn't even have a driver's license, she had literally no clue how to drive. Like to the point that she didn't know which pedal makes the car go and which makes the car stop.

The night we broke up was the night I finally couldn't stand that shit anymore (and honestly, the rest of our relationship was pretty much the same as her backseat driving). Pulled the car over, put it in park, walked around to her door, opened it, unbuckled her seat belt and told her to get out. She thought I was bluffing until I got back in, closed my door and drove off. Shit, she probably realized "this is why the parent flip out isnt the best way to handle shit when they were kids."That sounds like it was so fucking satisfying though. I wish I could do that with my mom. Op's dad gets aroundBut really, them drivers are about as legendary as they get. Almost 80% of drivers will never get close to such understanding and control of a vehicle ( with or without load, size of vehicle, the bells )
My dad nearly shat his pants in the passenger seat of one and he gets ticketed for speeding in his van all the time. As a firefighter I have people jam on the breaks directly in front of me then look appalled as I swerve around them. I dunno man, $50 for your mistake, or a dead relative and a totaled car...and maybe even a dead random stranger or two on top of it. I know which one I would pick. 3 miles would be 2 minutes at 90 mphNot really, no.  There was a practical portion too, and they would go over the mechanics of it if you needed it, but most people were expected to have (and did) learned from their parents, and the practical portion was just a mini-test to ensure you were competent enough to take the real test.>Also, if there’s literally a mile of cars and trucks backed up in front of me in the left lane, you can chill the fuck out and back off. There’s nowhere to go.

I agree, but GOD FUCKING HELP YOU if that mile of cars and trucks is BEHIND you and there's a fuckload of empty road in front of you. If you're sitting in the left lane doing fuckall but blocking traffic, I will absolutely communicate to you that you should get out of the lane.It's mostly just unfamiliarity. There are a lot of places in the US where  roundabouts are (sadly) a rare thing.If nobody's remembered to wind the roundabout that day then it won't turn properly, and that's when crashes happen."Dear God, I know I don't pray often, but please don't let these idiots kill me."

But please add that more than half the population is over the age of 75 and still have their licenses. Our retired population refuses to shut off their turn signals or they don’t use them at all. Grandmas and Grandpas will jump into their Cadillacs or Buicks to drive to Cracker Barrel five minutes away and they end up getting lost and driving up off ramps and vice versus.

I thought I was the only one!

The thing that really bugs me is that braking is one of the few ways that you can actually communicate with other drivers -- brake lights tell the people behind you "I'm slowing down and you should too". When people brake excessively, especially when they continually tap the brakes, they're effectively sending mixed signals to the people behind them.I think they have the mentality that someone else is now "winning" because they're able to fill that gap that you're allowing.  It's this weird thought that everyone's racing to the same place and because they got ahead you're "losing".  I fucking hate most drivers.  I see the frustrations though if you missed the light because of this gap. You literally save like 5 -10 minutes TOPs on a commute if you drive like a dickwad in heavy traffic.  It's not worth getting to where you're going all strung out to save a few minutes. 

But here's the problem.  People that do drive like that are too stupid to realize this.  They think they're getting far ahead and continue to be a danger to themselves and everyone else.  I don’t mind people coming into the gap if they use their blinker and give me plenty of warning that they want to come over. I’ll let off the gas a tiny bit so there’s plenty of room for them to come in and I still have my safety gap in front of me. What pisses me off is when they swing in front of me with no warning and now I have to hit my brakes and pray the person behind me is ready for me to do that. Fortunately I noticed those people are usually the first to leave when another gap opens up and 1 car in between still gives the breathing room with the gap Yeah interchanges here in MI see a lot of that happening. Especially on 96 and 94. Does anyone know what happened to I94 near Kalamazoo last Wednesday afternoon/night? It would have taken us an hour to get through a 10 miles stretch in front of the airport, but we got luckily directions around it. My phone was telling me that traffic jam was there for at least 6 hours!I'm glad she's OK, and sorry for laughing at your grandma Fucking especially at the exit 19 split, and usually at 22 or 23 when the douchebags try to dodge trafficI learned how to drive in Vermont, in the area I was in cars were extinct & it was rare to have to drive with a person behind you.

I moved to Rhode Island a few months ago and I’m *still* not confident driving with these maniacs that honk **the second** the light turns green, and sits on your ass even if Im going the speed limit...

speaking of, it's going to be 73 today and snowing tomorrow? I've knew winter would be here eventually.It's another episode of "Whose Lane is it Anyways?" where lines are made up, and traffic lights don't matter.thanks dadCheckmate>> She never complained again.

>  That’ll probably do it.

Or probably the murder OP didn't mention after the screaming fit.

*queue your phone ringing nonstop for the next few hours*Jesus christ that's terrible

I like when people say "take a left here," beginning the sentence as the turn is directly lined up with the car. Like wtf how do you think this works. Tell us where to turn BEFORE it comes up, people, idk why this is such a consistent problem

Knocking on the window though? Use your words lmaoslowlyboom!  i got math roasted.  i divided the wrong way :(Meanwhile in New Jersey, left lane exits on the highway! Gotta wonder who came up with that one.Fair enough. Kansas City isn't quite the middle of no where, I will give you the gateway status.KC is a great city! We have excellent BBQ!

And Google Fiber. 

(Im a Google Fiber customer.)KC is a very nice city, I used to live there You can predownload areas you'll need. I was in Colombia and used this when I was traveling through a few areas with lousy service. Mom: can you pick up this thing for me?

Me: sure, what's the address?

Mom: okay, so you get out onto hwy 90, and then you-

Me: no, Mom, just-- what is the address of the building? 

Mom: oh no it's really simple, just take 90 past 59 toward Dulles - you know that chandelier store we always laugh at? you'll pass that, and then-

Me: I don't want directions. I won't  remember them and they won't help me. I'll just put the address in my GPS. 

Mom: but it's so easy to get there! 

Me: Oh. My. God. What are the numbers on the outside of the building. EVEN BETTER, please just give me the name of the gotdamn business and I will look it up myself because this conversation has gotten us absolutely nowhere An old friend of mine lived in FL for a year before moving straight back to CO. His summation of the experience was thusly: “Everything there is 85. The temperature, the humidity, the average age, the average IQ...”There he goes. One of God's own prototypes. A high-powered mutant of some kind never even considered for mass production. Too weird to live, and too rare to die.Fear and Loathing?Make the bastard chase you. He will follow.We can't stop here, this is bat country!Not to mention the on ramps to 94 are like 4 feet long. Well we did get that obligatory single snowing before Halloween. It was all gone within 24 hours like usual.Nobody asked!Haha we haven't spoken in 15 years, so I think I'm pretty safe.

She's an absolutely awful person, but she also had a really, really bad upbringing. Abuse was common in her household, so I can see where she got some of her terrible habits from. That was the single most toxic relationship I've ever been in. I thought St. Louis was the gateway... Because of the arch?As always, there's a [relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/783/).This is exactly how it sounds. [Getting Mom Onto Internet A Sisyphean Ordeal](https://local.theonion.com/getting-mom-onto-internet-a-sisyphean-ordeal-1819566480)Yup. One of my favorite excerpts from itYeah. How they are designed is ao fucking weird. Some say that to this day she is still standing on the side of the roadYeah, well St. Louis can suck a dick.With as stubborn as she was, I wouldn't be shocked. 

Come to think of it, that was the last time I ever saw her. *The plot thickens*.....My time to shine.

I used to work at a printing press that also duplicated/replicated discs; meaning, all of that physical inventory you see in stores like DVD's, and CD's were made by us - BUT...we were cheaper than most places, so unsigned bands were our proverbial bread and butter. I had the privilege of listening to some of the most amazing music that flew under the radar. Here's a dump of great underdogs, some were done by us, but most are just merely criminally underrated. I don't endorse any of these bands, and haven't worked at the press for nearly 5 years.


[Brick + Mortar *Seven Years in the Mystic Room*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTj_16nI8g0) - Experimental Rock/HipHop - You might have heard their cover of Jimi Hendrix on the Hitman soundtrack, but all of their albums are fucking stunning.

[RX Bandits *Gemini, Her Majesty*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh3YBr5q9A&list=PLY944k5l1aEAGtjQb_VFuHWool6MQU4rl) - Experimental rock/ska - Insanely talented band that I've seen live without knowing who they are. They're directly connected to one of my other favorite bands listed below, The Sound of Animals Fighting which has the addition of Circa Survive/Saosin Vocalist Anthony Green.

[The Sound of Animals Fighting *The Ocean and the Sun*](https://youtu.be/t3o4mI_we-w?t=42) - They get weird, real weird. But this is their last album, and probably their most normal album as their previous two had weird interludes, but the songs are fantastic on all three albums. Insanely underrated band.

[Midlake *The Courage of Others*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL966A18A46DF49050) - Stoner folk/reminiscent to Fleet Foxes but with more somber toned vocals. Just fucking listen to this goddamn album, it's beautiful.

 [IllScarlett *All Day With It*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL115D5B0EB29637DA) - Stoner Ska, but a very talented Canadian band. Catchy tunes, and I realllllly fucking wish I could locate my physical copy of this album as it's difficult to find their tunes on YT.

[The Mountain Goats *Tallahassee*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rwLkEpxSC0&list=PL68EF2BAA7E6782C4) - Gut wrenching and beautiful lyrics. Folk music.

[MeWithoutYou *Catch For Us the Foxes*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDKlKOP6fDI) - Drop what you're doing, and listen to this goddamn album while reading each and every gorgeous lyric. Seriously has one of the best lyricists of the past few decades, the dude is a goddamn marvel that has some serious anguish in his voice.

[Levi Weaver *The Letters of Dr. Kurt Gödel*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5NgHvDebZo) Insanely talented folk/experimental musician, and sensational songwriter. I wish I could find more of his music, but this is one of the songs from that album. [He also does a kickass cover of Radiohead's *Idioteque*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA8-NX_LW7A)

[Authority Zero *A Passage in Time*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPH9NGNviO0) Ska/Rock Just a great fucking album, and makes me think of Tony Hawk Pro Skater.

[Reid Willis *Born of Kaleidoscope*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhx2gseZNxI) - Ambient/Electronic This album is fantastic, as is all his work, but his music is also difficult to track down.

[Patrick Sweany *Every Hour is a Dollar Gone*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqTFga1IOjY&list=PLL04X9v_QXgE820r1Y89JkLL-oFWqv3Ij) - Rock and Roll/Blues. This dude has passion, and is incredibly talented, but sadly doesn't get noticed frequently. This album was produced by Dan Auerbach from The Black Keys.

[Pegasus Dream *In Abesntia*](https://soundcloud.com/pegasusdream/sets/rootmusic-bandpage-1) - Practically no views, very few listens, this is basically underground and I can't figure out why as it's a very well done dream-pop album. I hate pop...Why the fuck do I love this album...

[Walking Oceans *Dear Isaac*](https://soundcloud.com/terrence-vitali/sets/walking-oceans-dear-isaac) Ambient instrumental - Incredibly well put together music, with virtually no views on sound cloud. I had this album on nonstop repeat at my desk for the entire duration of their project. On par with Explosions in the Sky, in my opinion.

[Radiation 4 *Wonderland*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccHNTriMSrE&list=PL851BD6D1D5E73A79) Experimental metal/math metal/circus metal - I don't even know where to begin. If you enjoy metal music, give this album a shot, it's ridiculously amazing. It seems they've taken influence from Mr. Bungle, and Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, but seem to be a bit more grounded (emphasis on "a bit"). Vocalist likes to use sound effects on his voice occasionally, which works very well with the circus vibe of their sound.

[Ellen Sundberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XmOeJy6RmE) - Country/folk rock - I think my guitar mentor actually produced this album, which is the only reason why I know of her because I think she's from Iceland or something, but she's damn good. I really dislike country, but she leans more towards folk and has just the right amount of twang.

[Keaton Henson *Dear*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02L2geOMGc) Actually reminds me a bit of Scout Niblett, and I'm not sure why. Just a dude and his guitar, very soft-spoken, and heartbroken. 

[Sorne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izb7R04_Heg) - Have no idea how to explain this dude. He's got really cool music videos, and his music is pretty amazing, but I can't categorize it's genre for the life of me. I jam to this song very frequently, and always watch the video in its entirety.

[Black Books](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh69anIXeGE) - Sound very reminiscent to Band of Horses. This is my favorite song of theirs, but this video absolutely rips my heart out of my chest.

[Polica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iz3WUEl_qHk) - Two drummers, a bassist, and a vocalist with a beautiful voice that uses  effects. Fairly poppy, but she's got some great lyrics, and the entire album of *Give You the Ghost* is fantastic. [Wandering Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yX4iIPlwS5c) is my favorite song by them, and the video is fantastic.

[Joanna Newsom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQIGraR3aI) Lovely voice, if not quirky, and plays harp beautifully. She's also married to Andy Samberg

[Jesse Stewart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEvQOPUHGH8) Dude with a mandolin plays his heart out, but really love every one of his songs. He's a bit unorthodox, but he's got sincere passion in every one of his songs.

[Hyro Da Hero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE4hdJphnao) - Hip hop/rap they're all cookie cutter IMO, that rely on a typical beat. Not this dude. I believe the band members, or at least one(?), are from the hardcore group *The Blood Brothers*. Not huge on rap, but I really dig this guy, and the music packs a fucking punch.

[The Claypool Lennon Delirium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCpJUyAibew) - Les Claypool of *Primus* and John Lennon's son Sean Lennon. Good god this album is good, but very kooky which is to be expected because Les Claypool is an absolute nut.

[Sunny Day Real Estate *How it Feels to be Something On*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcdghI0e7S0&t=1535s) - Incredible indie band from my childhood that doesn't get the recognition they deserve.

[The Appleseed Cast *Two Conversations*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U0bllvJUyQ&t=1085s) - Amazing indie band with conservative use of vocals, but the music is stellar.

[Megafauna *Maximalist*](https://soundcloud.com/megafauna/sets/maximalist) Fantastic rock and roll. The old physical CD I had of theirs broke, and these soundcloud tracks seem to have been re-recorded/remastered as a few of my favorite tracks are missing, and it sounds completely different. 

[COLOUR REVOLT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQqB4ri5_5c&list=PLXp4edtig0vSgJE6R5Vf8Tj5ELt_Yw6V8) - Rock/Indie Rock - They have 3 albums, and they're all incredible. Easily one of my favorite bands of all time, but are criminally underrated. The lead vocalist put out a very chill album under a different name listed below, and it's so goddamn good.

[El Obo *Oxford Basement Collection*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSZm6DBXkTU) Vocalist Jesse Coppenbarger for Colour Revolt released this experimental acoustic album. There are some serious Flaming Lips vibes on a few tracks. Incredible.

[Mad Gregs *Relatives*](https://soundcloud.com/mad-gregs-band) This album is an organized clusterfuck that is beautifully executed. When four talented multi-instrumentalists get together with a classical background, beautiful things happen. Heavy jazz influences, with some 80's pop undertones, experimental, and somehow has a Flaming Lips vibe in some areas, so they're probably the 2nd most polarizing on this list (next to Radiation 4). I'd start with track 8 - [Holiday Pearl](https://soundcloud.com/mad-gregs-band/08-holiday-pearl-1) which is just fantastic.

[Dr. Dog *Fate*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgaj0LHnJXE) Probably the closes we're going to get to The Beatles during this generation, and they have multiple singers just like the Beatles as well. Great album with incredibly talented musicians. Old school rock and roll from young musicians. [Here's their Tiny Desk Concert starter pack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzmvzcDWZjI) in case you're uncertain whether you want to dive into their extensive discography.

[Dinosaur Jr. *Farm*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfSo840sTmI&list=PLFgtLCsn09X3qCEKh9SuPdE4xChLwUKlJ) Rock and Roll. Great album with great musicians. This band and Dr. Dog are what I refer to as "commercial underground". They're signed, but don't get the recognition they deserve. PSA: 15 years ago was not the 90's.

We're talking 2002 here.Frightened Rabbit - the midnight organ fightPunch brothers - the phosphorescent blues

Basically the five best bluegrass musicians in the world got together to use bluegrass instruments to play anything but bluegrass. Super detailed complicated music, amazing lyrics, awesome instrumentals. There really isn't another band out there that is on their level. If you're a musician, listen to each song again for each instrument individually, and it will blow your mind with something new every time.

Cannot recommend these guys enough

EDIT: Since this is getting a lot of attention, here is one of my favorite live videos of them. It's a full show, almost two hours, and they play some of their best stuff. You can literally skip to any part of this video and it will be incredible. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P23yIVuYaDI)

Also, since people have mentioned it, their [kickass cover of Reptilia by the Strokes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qayc6yJXG-8)
[Elder - Lore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbKlR8AGYmQ). Great stoner rock/prog-metal album that I found out about due to an r/listentothis post a few months ago. I've listened to an album of theirs at least two or three times a week since finding out about them.

Honourable mention to their most recent album, [Reflections Of A Floating World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqMfWwnLtKg). Both are incredible, but Lore is just a smidge better in my opinion.Jeff Rosenstock - Worry. You looking for something to prove that not all pop-punk is bad? This album is it. The first half of the album contains extremely solid songs that share common themes with each other but the second half of the album is set up in "vignette form". It's essentially one big song that ends the album off perfectly. I'm just gonna list some of my favorites from different genres.

* [Ramshackle Glory - Live the Dream.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oK-79GfA9s) Folk Punk and one of my all time favorites. 

* [Radioactivity - s/t.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kQuC47tt8g) Punk Rock.

* [Elder - Dead Roots Stirring.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mZvARd0hY0) Stoner/Psychedelic rock.

* [Misantropic - Insomnia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKySJ4EABXE) Crust punk.

* [Insect Warfare - World Extermination.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voSHK1bAIN4) In my opinion one of the best Grindcore albums ever made.

* [Ritual Knife - Hate Invocation.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0zUUuuNV68) Black Metal? It's a bit different from the usual style.

* [Mgla - Exercises in Futility.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGPAVTYfXI) Black metal. I guess this one isn't that obscure especially to anyone familiar with the genre, but I'm still including it because it's fucking good.Pinegrove - Cardinal

They've been gaining ground, as of late, but I still think they're pretty obscure.

Edit: Dang look at all of those upvotes. Here's a sick video of Pinegrove playing their [new track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEWSccufu3c)

and here's their [Audiotree session](https://youtu.be/0JvG551iDTE)Alopecia - Why?[Emancipator - Soon It Will Be Cold Enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8WooPsxa68). One of my favorite albums of all time. 

EDIT: Added link for the lazyJon Hopkins - ImmunityMaps of Non-existent Places by Thank You Scientist.   Really, really good Prog/Fusion
https://youtu.be/n_XnJh_4ep0Nonagon Infinity by King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard. It's a looping prog rock/thrash album with 7/4 and other weird time signatures, flawless execution, and clear, audible lyrics that barely make sense when you're high.

Starting on a certain track also allows you to seamlessly chain into another of their works, "The Lord of Lightning VS. Balrog", a multi-part saga on their album "Murder of the Universe".Julien Baker - Turn Out The Lights

Holy heck is she good, this album will make you very sad (same with her previous LP).Casualties of Cool - Casualties of Cool

A sideproject by canadian songwriter/singer/guitar player Devin Townsend and singer Ché Aimee Dorval. 

It's basically a mix of ambient, dark country and space rock. 

If you like moody music for dark days, this is the masterpiece for that.

If you want a song to check out (though this is really a record you listen to from start to finish) listen to [The Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPG79uvQL2g) or [Ether](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIbu7m9_owo).AJJ: People Who Can Eat People are the Luckiest People in the World.

There's so much about them that's different that makes me like them so much. From using traditional folk instruments used in a punk rock manner, to their off-color lyricism. It's definitely an album you have to listen to more than once to really get the vibe, because it's pretty different, but it's so good.

Hippo Campus: Landmark

These guys are gaining some popularity, but they're still relatively new. Just a great alternative band all together.

John Frusciante: The Will to Death

John played guitar and was the backup vocals for Red Hot Chili Peppers for a very long time, coming in and out of the band to do solo work, spiral down a path of heroin abuse, and eventually getting sober. This album is part of his project where he wanted to release six albums in six months, and this is by far one of the best from that period.

Limes: Fresh Squeezed

This beat tape is probably my favorite to relax and put on, because it's a really good mix of jazz and hip hop.Animals by This Town Needs GunsPUP- The Dream is over The Thermals - The Body, The Blood, The Machine

[YouTube](https://youtu.be/sXeuZ9p8GuQ)

[Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9328-the-body-the-blood-the-machine/)[Destroyer - *Kaputt*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Su-N-iH8CgI&list=PLzbWgOaq3-_S8jy3aDbIygC1IyyMOHF5o)

Musically the album is "yacht rock" (think white linen suits, saxophone, guitar drenched in reverb), but the lyrics are cryptic barbs against capitalism and culture that are witty but shy of being pretentious. It's soothing and disrupting at once, and in a way I think it's the perfect 21st century album. Dan Bejar's probably best known as a member of The New Pornographers, but this project (which has been going on a *long* time) is where he shines. 

Also *Album* by Girls. It's twee and naive and catchy in a Beach Boys way and makes me think of the best summer of my life, so maybe it's just me. Haken - Affinity

https://youtu.be/-7pEXGCtnnk

https://youtu.be/yW8nBlZZvxM

First couple of songs. Such diverse progressive metal, the second link is '1985', a tribute to a whole decade in one song.

Ayreon - The Source

https://youtu.be/obySu2DExWY

More progressive metal/rock. While I unequivocally love all Ayreon albums, I think Arjen managed to best himself get again. Sci-fi concept album with several renowned vocalists playing different characters. Link is a song about a select group of people leaving a dying planet that is being destroyed by an AI of their own creation.Perturbator - [Dangerous Days](https://perturbator.bandcamp.com/album/dangerous-days)Agalloch - Ashes Against The GrainThe Hotelier - Home, Like Noplace Is There

Fantastic emo tinged alt rock, in the vein of Brand New, Manchester Orchestra, etc. Album is heavily framed around the concepts of mental health and by god if the last few lines of the album don't make you feel something when he sings them...

*I felt the noose tighten up on your collar bone* 

*I felt the gun in the small of your back*

*Engraved in the stone*

*By request and recurse of friends dead*

*is “Tell me again that it’s all in my head.*Hand Cannot Erase by Steven Wilson. Seriously, this guy has been making masterful music for a long long time and he did an amazing job with this album! 

I think I had the CD on repeat in my car for a good six months after I bought it. Andrew Bird - “the Mysterious Production of Eggs” Turnover - Peripheral Vision We Like it Here by Snarky Puppy

Edit: RIP inbox

Also to people saying they aren’t that obscure; they are, certainly in Europe. The OP asked for “relatively obscure.”

You only don’t think they’re obscure because you know who they are. And plenty of obscure acts win Grammys. Vektor - Terminal Redux. Not only is the music really good, but the storyline is awesome too.

Edit: [Link](https://youtu.be/qMCsv-zj56s). Two of my favorites:

Vulfpeck is amazing! A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!

This is their last album, which was just released: [Mr. Finish Line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3T8d50jzTk)

Fever Ray's debut album *Fever Ray* (and The Knife's *Shaking the Habitual*)



Fucked Up - David Comes to Life. A hardcore punk band writes a concept album about 2 people meeting in a lightbulb factory in the 70's and falling in love , her dying in an explosion accident, and the culprit later to be revealed as the unreliable narrator, who is then confronted by David, the main character. It's complex, weird, and beautiful...from a hardcore punk band.Danny Brown - Atrocity Exhibition, guy is barely known out of hip hop but this album perfectly captures the man's addiction and depressionNujabes - Modal Soul
  
Nujabes was a Japanese Jazz / Hip-hop producer who was truly a master of his craft. He utilizes samples from all different types of music from classical to electronic. He passed away while in his prime after a car accident back in 2010. 
  
Here's the first song off the album, one of my all-time favorites - [Feather (feat. Cise Starr & Akin)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-BWXT3UBns).
  
**Edit:**
  
Glad to see all the love for Nujabes!
  
There are a lot of commenters looking for his music on Spotify or streaming services – Unfortunately his music is not avaialbe for streaming, Nujabes, along with his estate, believed that his music was best suited to be listened to on physical media, therefore you will only find unofficial rips of his music unless you [purchase](https://www.hydeout-tribe.net/store_en/) his CDs from his label’s site. *It actually appears that you can stream some of his work on [Apple Music](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/artist/nujabes/id679712483).
  
Here are links to his albums:
  
[Metaphorical Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xZY8VJHqU4)  
[Modal Soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avBZXNYwuqc)

Also, my favorite mixtape of his:
  
[Ristorante Nujabes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIRHM-SYIRY)
  
He was also the main contributor for the Samurai Champloo soundtrack (alongside the very talented, [Fat Jon](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5Fmr3KeGe2IAVFmMxUq1sD)), I definitely recommend checking out the whole soundtrack, but my favorite disk is [Departure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnkGjXyCUVA&list=PLrUnQJ9SnItVRTsCd8fk7SSV8p72OrF-Z).
  
Shout-out to r/nujabes and a very interesting [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nujabes/comments/3fagps/the_story_of_aruarian_dance/) detailing the meticulous nature of Nujabes’ production for [Aruarian Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYRDgd3Tb44).
  
**Edit 2:**
  
Thank you for the gold! I'm just so glad that I was able to share this beautiful music with so many others today.
  
RIP Seba Jun.Are the Mountain Goats obscure enough? Because The Sunset Tree is a perfect album.

It's a biographical album about the front man's childhood and dealing with things like domestic violence. The album liner is dedicated to his step dad, the recurring culprit of domestic violence.

Culture Scars by Hail The Sun

[Trophy Eyes - Chemical Miracle](https://youtu.be/R7GMOoQAkCM) Somewhere between pop-punk, shoegaze, and hardcore. Every track is a banger with its own sound, and the lyrics are beautiful.

[Little Tybee - For Distant Viewing](https://youtu.be/VceprK500D4) Chill experimental progrock? I don't even know what to call it but it's beautifully written and complex.

[The Speed Of Sound In Seawater - First Contact](https://youtu.be/8oU0O5wx-fA) My favorite mathrock band, and unfortunately probably the last album they'll ever put out. Each song sounds beautiful on the surface but reads like an awful dream.

[Dance Gavin Dance - Instant Gratification](https://youtu.be/Qq_caFxzKqg) Kind of poppy post-hardcore. The most unique band in the genre. The Needle Drop gave this album a 2 but he is a liar.

[La Dispute - Wildlife](https://youtu.be/To5tfCFpYU4) One of the greatest lyricists in music ever.

[Tennyson - Like What?](https://youtu.be/M8EcUu0YHko) Future-jazz/hip-hop. Can't be beat.

[Polyenso - One Big Particular Loop](https://youtu.be/ApBg8dnhuGk) When an ex-metal band gets experimental.

Edit: How could I forget [Foxing - Dealer](https://youtu.be/doBAHzV0itY) post-emo altrock kinda.King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard - Nonagon Infinity

It’s a fast pace psych rock piece that takes you through a magical journey. Each of the 9 songs fade into the next seamlessly and is unique from one another. The last song goes right back into the first with a seamless transition making the album loop forever thus creating a Nonagon Infinity.Gojira - From Mars to Sirius.Frank Turner - Love Ire & Song

English folk punk/alternative and honestly love all of his albums, this is just the first one that I heard and still love everything about itBest Buds by Mom Jeans. These guys are amazing, and just signed a deal with a label so another album coming soon! But they’ve nearly quintupled in popularity since my friend and I started following them in January.

Edit: Glad to see so much love for Mom Jeans! Honorable mention to Bay Faction because they have some great tunes as well, Sasquatch .22 being a personal favorite.

https://youtu.be/Q-58SPR32x8
Between the Buried and Me - Colors

Gojira - From Mars to SiriusKarnivool - Sound AwakeUlver - Blood inside

Amazing dark experimental rock, a bit hard to get into but very worth the effort. "Your call" transitioning into "operator" still gives me goosebumps after 12 years.


Maybe slightly less obscure but also amazing:

Oceansize - Frames (best guitar work I have ever heard)

Of Montreal - Hissing fauna, are you the destroyer? (hipster indie rock, no single meh song)

Genghis Tron - Dead mountain mouth (rather brutal metal with the occasional synthetizer)Aesop Rock’s The Impossible Kid is a 10/10 for me. Stay Gold by First Aid KitReptilians by Starfucker

It's a great album by an Electronic Indie band from Oregon. I go to their shows whenever they come near me.End Credits - EDEN
Indiepop, edm

He's been somewhat rising in popularity in the past year and a half, but at the release of end credits he was quite unknown. Also my favourite album to date. Here is a list of the albums that when I first heard them, I just couldn't stop listening to them. Many of these I listened on repeat for weeks or even months. I really like listening to new music so this list might get long :P . I know some of these are not "obscure" but I want to give people the chance to hear a band they might not listen to in their normal circles.


**Major Parkinson - Twilight cinema** 

[Impermanence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb3EiIvSjqI)

An Experimental Rock group from Norway, it's hard kinda hard to describe their sound but it reminds me of [Over the Garden Wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAQZB98wewY) or like a nightmare about gypsies idk. If you like them check out...



[Woodkid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkb0kDacjs)

[The Dear Hunter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPLsrOzLew) (one of my all time favorite bands who deserve a spot of their own so...)



**The Dear Hunter - Acts I/II/III/IV/V**

[Acts I-V](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5eGNWtS-WM)

IMHO one of the greatest bands of our time. The Acts tell the story of a boy born to single mother in the 1890's. The songs go from his birth to his struggles with the corrupt priest that runs the town, to his time in WW1, to his falling in love, etc. A masterpiece.



**Brick & Mortar - Bangs**

[Locked in a cage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfrPU0Gk5r0)

An indie rock duo from New Jersey. One of my top 5 bands. Bangs is their best album by far. If you like them, the closest band i found to them is [IAMDYNAMITE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76anRLvSKHA) they changed their sound pretty drastically after their first album so don't really listen to their new stuff.



**Fleshgod Apocalypse - King**

[Full Album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ9nd7zm1MA&list=PL0dXFUZ_pE3NzHRg2c_jCvPF9r2oEN0Zq)

A Symphonic Death Metal band from Italy. If you don't like growls and guttural vocals this isn't for you. Fleshgod Apocalypse is a death metal band with heavy influences from classical and opera and they merge the very different genres beautifully. (new link, thank you u/asirr)



**The Moon Runners - Starblanket**

[Starblanket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4R1jfMV8io)

Here's one i guarantee no here has heard, as i am the only like on their youtube video :P A really good album even though they quite literally unheard of and one I listened to on repeat for like a month straight when it came out. They are on spotify too so give 'em a follow <3



**Pallbearer - Foundations of Burden**

[Full Album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N99KPZ2RsoM)

A doom metal band from Arkansas with very clean vocals and amazing instrumentals. Foundations of Burden is probably their best album. As with all doom metal, they have a very depressing sound. I listen to this album on repeat as I read Dracula for the first time and made it all the better.
If you like them check out...

[Khemmis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MQfTawVLeI&t=)


**Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror**

[The Ninth Wave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Px8WHr73wZw)

[Twilight of the Gods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CteS9v9sK3E)

[The Throne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBezDU8C_Q)

A Powermetal band from Germany. A band with one of the most epic sounds I've personally aver heard. I'm a huge fan of *beyond the red mirror* but a friend of mine says [A Night at the Opera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWeeV7N3vDM&list=PL_tuzEfnISdJB8-sXjgu6F2XsJNdKuMw3) is his favorite album.

**Shearwater - Animal Joy**

[Full Album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLVNOnFFvXo)

An Indie Rock band from Texas. A very chill band and a nice change of pace after all that metal. Very relaxing and their following album [Jet Plane and Oxbow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ButIZ6xAP2M) is equally as good.



**Gunship - Gunship**

[Tech Noir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nC5TBv3sfU) 

A Synthwave band from Britain. An Amazing band that takes Synthwave where no other band in the genre has before. If you are unfamiliar with with the Genre, its like a pseudo-80's electronic thing. It will remind you of things like Tron, Blade Runner, Etc. If you have been really into Stranger Things this might tide you over for awhile. If you like them check out...


[Dance with the Dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4E4kjQIw6M&t=)

[Perturbator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Vsf3zYppP4)

[Mitch Murder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hugowO0sSrM)

And by popular demand; [Carpenter Brut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY1s9SmrQRE)




**The Protomen - Act II - The Father of Death**


[Breaking Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMrFiOjxk5s)

[Light Up the Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkLvpt9Z3fA)
 

**Dry the River - Shallow Bed**

[New Ceremony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCJ22QQTWtM)

An Alternative Rock band from London. A very relaxing band, they even have an acoustic version of the above album that rivals the original. 



**Grimes - Visions**

[Genesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FH-q0I1fJY)

An adorable Electropop solo artist from Vancouver. Here stuff is a little weird if this isn't your style of music, but I found it very catchy and couldn't stop listening to it when it first came out.



**Hozier - Hozier**

[Take Me To Church](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVjiKRfKpPI)

[Angel of Small Death...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bmp4QWzHak)

A singer songwriter from Ireland. He is getting pretty popular with his song *Take Me To Church*, but the whole album is amazing and if you like that song, give the rest of the album a listen.



**The Kin - Get On It**

[Get On It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHQw1pbdKPE)

A short EP but a really good one. I would have put my favorite song by them; *Boy you're a pretty girl* but I don't think they have a studio version on Youtube. 



**Ratatat - Classics**

[Loud Pipes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64liF2VuLxI)

An Electronic Duo from Brooklyn. They are completely instrumental and have unique sound that is unmistakable. They performed with Kid Cudi on two of his songs, most notably [Pursuit of Happiness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq_uy1qcO-k)


Jesus this list is getting out of hand. I could go on forever but I should probably stop here. If anyone has any questions or wants to share a band with me feel free.


-Edit-



**A Silent Film - Sand & Snow**

[Harbour Lights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_2lTxtxi7U)

A really good album that takes me back to highschool and innocent, young love :')


**X Ambassadors - Love songs Drug Songs**

[Love Songs Drug Songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtRynSVzpMM)

The next Imagine Dragons. Enjoy them while you can, I swear you'll here them everywhere in a few years and it will annoy the hell out of you.



**Half Moon Run - Dark Eyes**

[Full Album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIYOxxz9YFg)

[Call Me In The Afternoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_yengUrkaU)


**Active Child - You Are All I See**

[Johhny Belinda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9SNJC3YcTQ)

Super chill singer songwriter.


**Alex Clare - The Lateness of the Hour**


[Up All Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAlU5xqU6fQ)


A solid album with great songs like [Hummingbird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5Jr4xIc-Zs)
and [Too Close](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP50Ewh31E4)

**The Birthday Massacre - Walking With Strangers**

[Full album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9B8VVH4Uro)

[Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrQ1vq_Osaw)

An Electric/Dark Wave band from Ontario. Great for when you want to feel like and angsty emo 13 year old. I still love them though.

-Edit- I wanted to add my absolute favorite albums to here, so here


**The Antlers - Burst Apart**

[Full Album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMWXvRJc5c&t=)

I know Hospice is their more popular album but I prefer this one idk why. 


**Sonata Arctica - Winterheart's Guild/Ecliptica**

[Winterheart's Guild](https://youtu.be/ek7jUrVK04w)

[Ecliptica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7oOWO6xT3Y)

Sonata is my all time favorite band and these are two best albums. Ecliptica is their most famous and contains the song [Fullmoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfI8o_hzaDk) which is their most famous song.


**Stratovarius - Nemesis**

[Nemesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GatqruHJPWk&t=)

Maybe not their most famous album as its a more recent one, but in my opinion their new stuff is actually better. chech out *unbreakable* on this album.


-Edit- 

for those of you who like doom metal here is bell witches new album that is composed of a single, 83 minute song

[Mirror Reaper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10q1ZJyLXFk) 

not my favorite album but its fun to listen to for the novelty of it.The Sword - Age of WintersDrive By Truckers - The Dirty South 

Perturbator - The Uncanny Valley

Shiny Toy Guns - Season of Poison

The Dear Hunter - Act III

Dance Gavin Dance - Mothership

I could pick so many more... but I gotta get ready for work!
Celebration Rock by Japandroids, it'll make your heart soarRainbow Kitten Surprise - RKS

Super fun and sometimes dark, but these guys put on a great show and I can listen to the album all the way through. Apparently they played at Bonaroo, so not sure how obscure they are. They were new to me when I saw them in Chattanooga.Armor for Sleep- What to do when you are deadWe Were Promised Jetpacks - These Four WallsDeerhunter- Halcyon Digest

Many a night in college spent studying to thatPeripheral Vision by Turnover. Incredible album and to me a masterpiece for the genre.Agalloch - The Mantle is one of the most phenomenal metal albums ever  in my opinion. Ever track leads perfectly into the next, the musicianship and artistry of this album is sadly under appreciated.Nothing but Thieves by Nothing but Thievesanother eternity by Purity Ring is one of my favourite albums ever. They’re a weird electronic/pop duo, and their music is incredible to get lost in.  The Midnight - Endless Summer[The Dear Hunter](https://youtu.be/XjE2Te1ixg0)

Progressive rock. Currently 5 main acts (albums). I've linked the fifth. Discovered these guys last year, haven't stopped listening since, they have a really unique sound. They were also recently touring with Coheed and Cambria.

Edit: Dear not Deer, whoopsEvery Time I Die - Low Teens

Buffalo Hardcore, possibly the best album the band has released in their twenty years.This thread: actually obscure bands that are sourced well[.](https://imgur.com/cXA7XxW)

You did good today, Askreddit. Sunn0))) Monoliths and Dimensions  "A dense and arrhythmic blend of metal, drone, and minimalist music"Jungle by Jungle. Love that group. I love the video for Time, and I think the video for Busy Earnin' and the song is used for some things but not many people know who they are. Sylvan Esso (self titled album) so awesome. Polyphia. A young instrumental progressive metal band from Texas.

They only have 2 albums and 2 EPs and my favorite song is off their first album, *Muse*, but *Renaissance* has more music with fewer guests.

[Polyphia- James Franco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FK5P94toDkI) *Muse*

[Polyphia- Nightmare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0Z6gljz9_Y) *Renaissance*

[Polyphia- Goose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVSqUl-FtCI) *The Most Hated (EP)*Dr Dog - Fate

Amazing indie band, songwriting up there with The Beatles imoZaba- Glass Animals Horse the Band - The Mechanical Hand

EDIT: Feast your ears upon this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTRcZwPbhUcMaybe not that obscure, but Baroness’ Blue RecordWho Will Cut Our Hair When We're Gone? 
By The unicorns 
It's fantastic. Counterparts - You're Not You AnymoreKing Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard - Nonogon Infinity. This is the album for everyone who thinks rock is dead.

Animal Collective - Merriweather Post Pavillion. This is the album for everyone who thinks all modern pop music sucks.

Flying Lotus - Cosmogramma. This is the album for everyone who thinks that electronic music is just a bunch of talentless musicians pushing buttons.

Edit: just thought of this one: Brockhampton - Saturation. Probably one of the best hip-hop albums of the decade so far.

Edit 2: a lot of yall have been saying that these picks aren't obscure enough, so I'm gonna throw in a few more.

For some more obscure hip-hop: Injury Reserve - Live at the Dentist Office and Ratking - So It Goes

For some more obscure pop: Ariel Pink - Before TodayArchitects - All Our Gods Have Abandoned UsSomeone please make a Spotify playlist of songs from this thread, I will gladly pay if I could!Imo metal is in a new golden age.

She's obscure if you never bothered to look her up after Somebody That I Used To KnowRiverside - Second Life Syndrome and Anno Domini High Definition Kezia by Protest the Hero El-P - Fantastic Damage

While he's fairly well known now as part of Run the Jewels, this album is, imo, his best work.

https://youtu.be/VUFDo0fi6EQThe Smith Street Band - Throw Me in the Rivermewithoutyou -Pale HorsesThe dream is over - PUPRishloo - Feathergun  
Not their most recent (which is good) but Feathergun is just a little more raw than the latest. It is a tremendous and beautiful thing. Sort of metal, sort of prog, sort of like nothing else I know.The First Days of Spring by Noah and the Whale The Resignation by Rx Bandits

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb6yggmEUIg) is the I recommend the most to people.

I have more too lmao
well since this thread now has over 16 thousand comments it looks like this will get buried, but thank you for this list! just listened to the first few minutes of 7 years in the mystic room and it's fantastic!Oh shit! Um...I meant 25 years...shit thanks for reminding me 😓This entire album is gold.  I don’t understand how they are not more popular.I really loved Pedestrian Verse!  Their new album is ok tooFrightened Rabbit as a whole is a truly underrated band. Just amazing!Goat Rodeo Sessions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtAITPpMzWI&list=PLBidRcbIwDxrWNsvXeYXw2dZ8N2cPO_bM is another example of the greatest instrumental bluegrass musicians (and also YoYo Ma) making beautiful music. Also Chris Thile is in both Goat Rodeo Sessions and Punch Brothers. Love that band and that album.

Piggybacking here to also recommend Nickel Creek - A Dotted Line and also Why Should the Fire Die.

Chris Thile is regarded as one of if not the best mandolin player on the planet, and he plays in both Nickel Creek and The Punch Brothers.

Punch Brothers is anything but bluegrass, Nickel Creek is...Pop bluegrass? Kinda hard to put a genre on them. They also do a sick cover of Britney Spear's Toxic live - it's worth a YouTube (I'd link but I'm home sick and on mobile...).The first song on Phospherecent Blues, Familiarity, gives me chills everytime it gets to "God knows I need it" part. Amazing a bluegrass quintet can sound so epic Exact same answer as me. The Phosphorescent Blues blew me away. It's perfect. So glad to see this made the list. This is my favorite album. You should also check out Chris Thile & Brad Melhdau.GOD HELP ME FEEEEEL ITDiscovered these dudes on Dead Roots Stirring, which is my personal favorite of theirs.  These two are magnificent as well.Reflections of a floating world is one of the top 10 albums this year.Fun story about Jeff Rosenstock I was drunk and 17 and went to see BTMI! and I kept yelling at them to play Rocket Rocket Rocketship and he pointed at me and said “this guy is bumming me out” and my only story of him is bumming him out and it wasn’t actually a fun story it’s a story of me being an asshole and I’m just saying this because I wish I could apologize because I still feel like an assholeCame here to say this. "Worry" is like a revisit to a lost Punk-o-ramma mix CD from the mid 2000's only it's a masterpiece all by one artist. From track to track it really goes to different places and highlights the best of different styles of music within a genre. They way one track flows into the next makes you never want to skip around and listen to this work as a whole album. 

[Wave Goodnight to Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7MPzv78cWs)
“The song of the American dorm room”It doesn't exist!jeff rosenstock is a god. BTMI! is one of my favorite “bands” of all timeWEEEE DDDOOONNNTTT WWAAAANNNTTT TOOO LIIIIIVVVEE IIIIINNNNNNSSSSIIIDDDDEEEE AAAA HEEEEELLLLHOOOOLLEPIETRO, 60 YEARS OLD, WILL YOU WAIT FOR MEPersonally though *We Cool?* was better, but *Worry* is also fantastic. Live the Dream is even better after you've listened to Pat's earlier works. His journey is incredible and hearing him finally find some sort of hope in Live the Dream solidifies it as my favorite all-time album. Mgła are so good. I'm partial to With Hearts Towards None though.I think their Audiotree session is better than any studio record. There is something about them playing live that is just amazing.

Edit-[Link for those who would like to be blown away.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JvG551iDTE)

Edit 2-[Their NPR Tiny Desk Session is also freaking brilliant!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weL8HTY1NJU)Aphasia is such a good song!

Love the album, the new song they've released recently is good too*breathe in*

WALKIN OUTSIDE LABYRINTHIAN OVER^^w^aaaaaaashing wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiindows with AngelinaFUCK. YES. They have become my absolute favorite band since I started listening to them a few months ago. 

Tix to see them in Boston - see y'all there! God damn do I love me some Pinegrove. Cardinal was a masterpiece and I’m super stoked for the new record.Old Friends makes me cry every fuckin time dammitWhy? is criminally underrated. Alopecia is just perfect from start to finish.I've listened to 15 seconds of The Vowels, Pt 2 and I have to say thanks, especially if the rest of the album is this goodYessss. Alopecia, Elephant Eyelash, and Eskimo Snow are 3 of my favorite albums ever. I really loved Moh Lean as well. Shit, Why? is just an amazing band. Yoni is a master songwriterI dunno, you tell me***I'D BE OK COOL AS A RAIL IF THEY JUST LET US HAVE HEALTH FOOD IN HELL***Elephant Eyelash is a close second and Hymie's Basement is dope too. Wow I'm really pleased to see this so high up, I figured I'd have to add it myself!

Yoni's album from last year with Serengeti called *Testarossa* reminds me of those Alopecia vibes a lot, and WHY?'s new album Moh Lhean is pretty great too.I came here to post this. It's my favorite album of all time. Moh Lhean was surprisingly good this year as well. 

I encourage everyone to check out the rest of the anticon record label too. I highly recommend Doseone's stuff, Baths, Jel, cLOUDDEAD, Hymie's Basement and Deep Puddle Dynamics.

Lastly, there's /r/anticon that could use some love.Wow. I know he's not a super small time artist or anything, but it's cool seeing Emancipator at the top. He makes some very, very good music.

I heard his song Lionheart in like 2009, and I listened to it on repeat for like a week. I've since listened to most of his music, and he's got a talent for beautiful, down tempo, nice to listen to music.

If anyone hasn't heard of him, start with this album and Soon It Will Be Cold Enough. I'd describe him as mostly instrumental, down tempo (but not boring) hip-hop jazz. If you like music from Bonobo, Nujabes (who was actually Emancipators mentor), etc, you'll like Emancipator.

Quick story about Douglas Appling himself...I was making a presentation for a project at school, and wanted to use his music as background noise. I emailed him to get permission, not expecting an answer and expecting to just use 30 second clips of his songs...but he emailed back the same day, thanked me for listening to his music, and said I could absolutely use his music. He just asked I put a credit in the presentation somewhere. 

I love Emancipator, sorry if this got a little long. I'm just excited to see him in the thread :)New album  in 3 days!Safe in the Steep Cliffs is great too"Soon It Will Be Cold Enough" sounds like an album put out by Bon Iver in the summer. Emancipator - Seven Seas is also an incredible album from start to finish. I love to listen to this album working outside in the snow. It just makes me feel so...at peace. Emancipator makes really beautiful music!If you like Emancipator, You may also like these albums:

Saltillo  - Ganglion

Ginormous - At night, under artificial nights

Blue Sky Black Death - Late night cinema

Trifonic - Emergence

aaaaaand.... Ulrich Schnauss - A strangely isolated place. Loved this album. Open Eye Signal is such a tune!

Incidentally, he produced the song 'Big Picture' from the new London Grammar album, who, as you can probably guess from my username, are one of my favourite groups. Hardly obscure, but still great.It's up there with Burial - Untrue.

Also new album next year!

Edit: Even if you don’t check out the full album check out Open Eye Signal, absolute glorious musical journey.

He did mention on his Facebook he’s taking time completely off touring to finish the album, so high hopes for something next year.I'm more of a fan of 'Insides'Jon Hopkins is fucking amazing. Have you ever seen [Monsters](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1470827/)? His score for that is gorgeous.I:

(1) Clicked the link

(2) Checked to see if I had set the playback speed too high

(3) Thought, *this sounds like a boss battle in Super Mario Galaxy*

(4) Started typing this response

(5) Wondered how many genres the song would pass through before I finished typing this.  Like 8?

Bravo.So damn good. I like Stranger Heads Prevail even more, honestly. They're both amazing. I'd never heard of them until I saw them open for Coheed a few years back, they put on an amazing show! Love all of their stuff Saw them open for Coheed and Cambria on the In Keeping Secrets neverender. Even met them after the show (super nice dudes, they were enthralled a white kid had an afro). I have never been more impressed by an opening act. These guys killed it, and couldn't be nicer. Nonagon Infinity nutted in my brain and I couldn't stop listening until my son hatched from my eye.Go king gizzard!! How many albums have they put out in 2017 so far?I’m surprised it took me this long to find a mention for Gizz.

I got into them when Quarters was their most recent. I would recommend that, Nonagon Infinity, and I’m in Your Mind Fuzz.

Honestly, their entire discography is 10/10I went through a ton of personal tragedy and struggle last year and I can't tell you how many times I put on Sprained Ankle and went for a run just to keep my head right.  (I get the irony).

Did not realize this new one was out already, but I'm cuing it up now.

I am not in her target demo (late 30's dude) but she is a special talent that really hits the right notes for me, especially over the last year.Julien Baker is amazing and my favorite to listen to right now. Her songs are so simple, yet amazing and powerful. Sprained Ankle is also a 10/10 album. Happy To Be Here is my fav song of 2017Album of the fucking year. That sounds awesome! Just got into Devin Townsend about a month ago, and currently have the album Transcendence on repeat. > AJJ

They’re touring right now playing that record front to back (...and then lots of other stuff because it’s 30 minutes) and that. Shit. Rules.

I saw them play two shows in NYC and it was the best time I’ve had in months. Catch one of the shows before the tour ends if you can.> John Frusciante: The Will to Death

+1 for this guy. "The Empyrean" album is one of my favorite things to listen to. Will check this one out. Hippo Campus is so freaking good! I wanted to see them when they came to OKC but I was busy.Hippo Campus is gnarly. MATH ROCK ISNT DEADTo anyone that digs this, Their sophomore album which is like 13:00:00:0 or some shit is also really really good. [2 birds, 1 stone, and an empty stomach ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=74LC1Aeftso) is a truly beautiful song Chinchilla will always be one of my favourite songs I spent weeks trying to transpose the trumpet part from Elk to saxophone when I was in middle school band lmao. Fucking love this album.11/10 dude, one of my favourite albumsThis album is awesome. I cannot believe how precise that guitarist's tapping is on such a clean channel. Doing 180 on the Don Valley Parkway!! "YOU HAVEN'T BEEN EATING I THOUGHT YOU WERE SLEEPING BUT..."Oh man I discovered them this year and I don't think I have listened to a full album as many times as I have that. They have become my favorite band in all honestyCome for DVP, stay for Sleep in the Heat. First album is an absolute banger, too. Yup. Seeing them next year and I can't waitThey used to say, “Don’t quit your day job.”

Well guess what?

***I NEVER HAD ONE!!***


Saw these cats playing with Modern Baseball in Houston a few years ago. MB didn't give two shits about the venue or the fans, but PUP was different. PUP absolutely killed their set, hung out with fans and were genuinely good dudes. They made a forever fan that day. I gave here to say rented world by the menzingers... I'm seeing them supported by pup in January and my boner knows know limits at that thought. [deleted]Destroyer is Incredible. Besides Kaputt, Destroyers Rubies are some of my favorite albums of recent years.Wasting away, chasing some girls....

Alright chasing cocaine...

Good stuffGirls - album is fucking fantastic.  It's so catchy and sad at the same timeHaken is pretty well known in the ProgMetal community...which basically means no one outside of that community will know who they are, good choice.  Though I would recommend the Mountain over Affinity but that's just me. Yes! Thank you for posting Ayreon. Was getting glum that had to scroll so far.

I'd strongly suggest 'The Human Equation" if you've never listened to any of Ayreon. It's not a perfect album and has some dud songs. But, I think it's the most approachable in terms of themes. It's still within the last 15 years.I was here for some Ayreon. The ending for The Source gave me some hardcore chills the first time I heard it.Glad to see Ayreon here. To piggyback off of this, I'd recommend What Kind of Creature Am I? by Toehider. Mike Mills (who has now appeared on two Ayreon albums) has such an incredible vocal range and his YouTube videos only get a few thousand views. He's actually uploaded this whole album with the lyrics to his YouTube channel, but I don't know how to link it since I'm on mobile. Venger is a great trackThat has probably his best track (Humans Are Such Easy Prey). I like New Model a little more.Carpenter Brut's Trilogy is another masterwork in synthwave, up there with Perturbator for sure.The Mantle will always be my favorite album of theirs, but you really can't go wrong with Agalloch Marrow of the Spirit is a perfect 10/10 to me. Nothing on any of their other albums comes close to that verse on Black Lake Nidstång. I prefer The Mantle.I died when they broke up. The track "Sowilo Rune" from the White EP is one of my favorites in the neo folk genre. I suppose Agalloch is obscure enough for askreddit. This and The Mantle are 10/10 all day. Anything and everything by Agalloch is 10/10Favorite emo album since American Football s/t. Absolutely heartbreaking album. Great to have an album in that style talk about something important for once, too.

Saw em a week ago for the millionth time. OOOOPEN THE CURTAINS And the pills

That you gave didn't do anything

I just slept for years on end

FUCK!

Here's an amazing performance of them playing the album in full at The Fest:

https://youtu.be/Prp78ypkQzYI wish I could give more upvotes. Album has been played weekly for 2 years now and I can't love it enough. So good.I drove 4 hours to see Hotelier despite never had listening to them before (my friends band was opening for them), and that shit was absolutely radI CALLED IN SICK, FROM YOUR FUUUUNERALLLThe Raven That Refused to Sing is amazing too. Especially if you're into more jazzy stuff.To be fair, Steven Wilson might be too famous for this thread. He's pretty much the face of today's prog.Yes! Steve is brilliant. This was such a perfect album. Also if you've not seen the [music video for routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sh5mWzKlhQY) I would HIGHLY recommend it. Onion cutting stuff.Was searching for Porcupine Tree (Fear of a Blank Planet, in particular) and was happy to see this up so high.I wish I could do anything half as good as Andrew bird whistles My mom was always into obscure music. The last song she showed me before she died in 2006 was “skin is, my”

And sure enough the whole album is good.

Thankful it’s good too. Can you imagine if it was just bad? Oh man. Also, everything else by Andrew Bird. 

~~Polanski~~ *Pulaski* at Night, which I suppose is technically an EP, is one of my faves. 

Edit: Ah shit a typo is ~~one of~~ my highest rated comments now.AB had 814,000 monthly listeners on Spotify. He’s not terribly obscure.

Edit: I stand corrected. Gojira higher up in this thread has 600,000 listeners. Fair enough! This is a solid album. Armchairs is the best song ever written.Dizzy on the comedown is such a GREAT song. Cory Henry's solo on Lingus is one of the craziest things I've ever heard. Wow. This was the first one that came to my head. Didn't expect it to be the first one I see. 

Snarky is great, possibly a new album and tour this year!Genre?Snarky Puppy is one of my favorites. They're just amazingly talented, *great* live, and really bring it. 

Great band, great album, everyone should know about their awesomeness. All band profits split evenly 47 ways! Vektor are probably my favorite out of the new generation of thrash metal bands, Terminal Redux is amazing.I prefer black future but all three of their albums are 10/10That is the best Menzingers album.

Edit: your opinions are all valid, even if they're wrong! :pCar Seat Headrest might be pushing obscure at this point considering their 2017 festival tour, but that's a great album. Makes me so happy to see The Menzingers this high up in the thread.  I felt American for once in my lifeOn the Impossible Past fucks me upOh man yes... Car Seat Headrest. Just yes."I will fuck this up, I fucking know it."Probably the most devastating album I've ever listened toFirst off.  

Kettering.  

Also, I think you would like/r/dirgemusicUsually dislike when people say it, but I really did want to comment this.

If you need a cathartic experience, sit in an empty room and listen to this. And cry. A LOT.I was going to bring this one up.  So depressing I basically can't listen to it anymore.  

It also happened to hit me at just the right point.  A friend pointed me to the song Two when I was in the midst of an abusive relationship and it hit a little too close to home.  Not sure any song ever has or will have the impact that song had on me at that point in time.

Helped push me toward ending the relationship, which I think them for.Very sad album right here. Nice choice This is one of my top 5 albums ever. Perhaps top 3.

I discovered this album on accident in the fall of 2015. I had just gotten past the worst 2 years of my life, including an awful conclusion to an abusive relationship. I heard the band mentioned on some local indie radio station but only caught the last half of the track. The DJ mentioned how much she loved that album but couldn't listen to it anymore. For whatever reason I decided to go home and listen to it myself.

It was a cold friday night and it had been a long week. I was mentally drained and had a bit to drink. I sat and put the album on intending to just check it out before I went out later that evening.

I sat and listened to it from start to finish. Then I listened to it all the way through again. It leveled me. I've only had that reaction a handful of times. It hit exactly where I needed it to. Someone else had been through what I had been through. Someone else had managed to put into words the feeling of hopelessness, emptiness, and helplessness that being in that situation brings. Knowing that you can't help someone that doesn't want to be helped. The feeling that no matter what you feel for someone, you can't make them feel the same things back for you. Trying your hardest to help someone only to watch them fail themselves and fail you in the same process. I had never had something resonate so strongly or summarize my state so eloquently. It was incredible. I love that album.

I can't listen to it often, and when I do, I will only listen to it beginning to end. It is devastating and it hurts but it is incredible at the same time. I can't speak more highly of that record.Winnipeg is a frozen shitholeEvery time I see a pigeon..It's so funky! And it's low volumeI was looking through this post to find Lord Huron and you did not disappoint - though I prefer “Strange Trails” although that’s kind of become more known because I think(?) “The Night We Met” was featured on that 13 Reasons Why show?See I was gonna say Lord Huron But then in the last year I felt like they were/are becoming more known/popular. They had a song in 2 different movies now and then on the Netflix show so I was like do they still count?

I still recommend them known or not.I played this album on repeat for months after I decided to take a chance and buy a cd from an artist I had never heard of.that cocaine music video 👌 Cheap Beer is my jam.I DON'T CARE IF YOU THINK IT'S COOOOOOOOLI dropped out of university after listening to that album on repeat for months... then I went back to university because wtf else was I gonna do.If I ever need a good cry I just toss on Elephant or Cover Me Up and I know it's a coming'.His two albums since Southeastern are great. But Southeastern is just one of those 10/10 albums that can't be topped.His album The Nashville Sound (as Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit) is fucking breathtaking as well. When I put it on for the first time and heard Last of My Kind I sat down in shock. I moved to the city to go to college from a town of 800 people over 32 square miles. The pain he talked about hit me hard in the chest, and the rest of the album doesn't slow, it's incredible. As much of a modern classic for me as Boards of Canada "Music Has the Right to Children."I love what he said about Dark Souls - 
>Hopefully by the end of most years I have done some tunes that are decent enough to release. but Dark Souls 2 is on the horizon soon so I’m not sure if I will have many new tunes for a while because I need to play that game a lot. But I’m going to try to get some new tunes together before it comes out.Burial is unreal, such an emotion invoking artist. [This comic sums it up perfectly.](https://i.rbt.asia/mu/image/1339/20/1339205662637.png) This is basically all I've listened to in the past couple of weeks now that it's getting cold and dark. Also would 100% recommend the Rival Dealer EPFor those that would like to know more about the genius that is Burial, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Et5B-zfAIIo) (actually just released a week ago by Resident Advisor) dives into his 2007 magnum opus of an album.  came here to say this.....also going to see him and run the jewels tonight :DDanny Brown is great but definitely an acquired taste.IM SWEATIN LIKE IM IN A RAVEAin't It Funny is probably one of the best songs ever made and I don't say that lightly. Wait, wasn't Atrocity Exhibition one of the most celebrated hip hop albums of that year? He's far from barely known.Really Doe bangs so hard. fuck.Danny Brown is obscure?... 

wutI got on his shit after xxx and I've found atrocity exhibition harder to get into. Old is my favorite though. I think he also did some work on the anime series Samurai Champloo, which is really legit. Rest in Beats, Nujabes.

He basically started the whole chillhop wave like mounika, Cradle Orchestra, Poldoore, Blazo, The Cancel... If it wasn't for Nujabes, these people would've be unknown or they would never write their awesome music in the first place.

Nujabes still inspire people with his music. He collabed with great people to make beautiful sounds. He's missed very much.Modal Soul is a fantastic album, I’m not really a hip hop fan but I love the sound of Nujabes. The Luv(Sic) Hexalogy is also amazing, albeit very sad in light of his untimely death.God, so much good stuff in the downtempo / insturmental hip hop genre.  Your post reminded me of an EP I would almost call a 10/10.  Dj Rum - Mountains EP It's in the Burial-esq downtempo bass music genre.  I think the two songs Mountains Pt1 and Mountains Pt 2 & 3 are perfect together.  It's very simple downtempo, but every time I listen to it I hear something new.  You discover the depths of the music the more and more you listen.

And I think it qualifies for pretty unknown since the whole EP isn't even on youtube!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUg6eJZEWwk&list=PL5030E3229BC0428Eliterally one of the most popular producers everFeather is a masterpiece. In case my fellow Mountain Goats fans aren't aware, there's a new podcast called [I Only Listen to the Mountain Goats](http://www.nightvalepresents.com/ionlylistentothemountaingoats/) and they're starting by going through All Hail West Texas, song-by-song, with a cover of each song at the end of the episode. Also, you get to hear John Darnielle's wonderful thoughts and voice. HIGHLY recommended. The Mountain Goats have released about 6 perfect albums in the last 10 years Somewhere at the Bottom of the River Between Vega and Altair fucked me upking park too intense 4 me Flamingo Trigger will always have a place in my heart, but this is genuinely their best release. Church of Rock and Roll has a couple really good ones though. Caught Circa on the 10 year anniversary tour for On Letting Go. T'was amazing.I'd nominate Wake over Culture Scars, but both are absolutely amazing.if you like Circa Survive check out this [Saosin EP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJSoFbkZ0_U) when anthony green was the lead. This was one of the OG pioneers in post hardcore. Also if you like Hail the Sun im assuming you like Dance Gavin Dance?**NONAGON INFINITY OPENS THE DOOR**From Mars to Sirius is incredible, definitely my favourite Gojira album.

I think the band also deserves credit for last year’s Magma album. It’s a much more stripped-down approach to their music but it somehow doesn’t lose any of the heaviness or nuance. Even my 60-year-old mum really likes Magma.I absolutely love this album, but isn't it pretty well known amongst metalheads?Is Gojira obscure? I’m not a metalhead but I thought they were a big deal in the metal scene...Or basically any other release by them, that band is amazing.I stumbled upon these guys watching some Lost in Vegas vids on YouTube.  They react to “Stranded.”  That was less than a week ago and I’ve probably listened to it 50x since.Well we've been a few hours drinking,

So I'll say what everyone's thinking.

If we're trapped on this ship and it's sinking,

We might as well have a parade!Id vote England Keep My Bones but fuck yes. I love the hell out of Frank TurnerI've been listening to and spreading the gospel of Frank Turner since 2010. He's one of my favorite artists of all time, and he's honestly got a song for everything. "The Road" is my travel anthem, "If Ever I Stray" is one of my favorite drinking songs ever written, and "Long Live the Queen" got me through the death of one of my best friends a couple of years ago. I never get tired of listening to him or seeing him live, he and his band put on such a great show.Yeah, Mom Jeans!!!/r/emo and /r/poppunkers sweethearts are dominating this thread, I love it.This thread was meant for Mom Jeans.!! They're recent stuff on *Now That's What I Call Music Vol. 420* is so good!Mom Jeans is going to be the next big thing in emo. If you enjoy anything remotely considered emo you have to check this album out. Get in now so you can still say "I listened to them before they were cool"Colors is so strong start to finish. The Great Misdirect is also an amazing album with more genre fusion (something I really enjoy from BTBAM).Colors might be my favorite album of all timeJust been getting into The Lion's Roar. Will definitely be giving Stay Gold a listen tooTheir shows are insane!Scrolled very far just to see an EDEN mention. Favorite artist since 2013, ITYTTMOM was also gorgeous and I expect Vertigo to be just as good after hearing Gold and start//endThe Dear Hunter is amazing!

EDIT:  if the acts or Colorado spectrum are too daunting to start with, check out Migrant it's a standalone album but with a fantastic variety of songs to check them outI'd say Carpenter Brut is perfect synthwave. his Trilogy album. Tech Noir is such a great album. Really opened my eyes to synthwaveLove Grimes!Oh gosh, I love Loud Pipes. I usually got Ratatat on Pandora when I would listen to LCD Soundsystem radio. Loud Pipes has all the best tracks.Really got into Hozier recently, lyrically super interesting and his compositions are fantastic.Oh damn, Baroness! I have really enjoyed Yellow and Green. Personally I enjoyed Cocanium.Never expected to see anyone talking about Brick + Mortar on reddit, but they are amazing and put on a great live show as well. Might as well add "At the Edge of Time" by Blind Guardian to the list. Huge shame that those guys are an obscure band considering that they are among the best metal bands of all time.I feel like X Ambassadors already had their peak, after i first heard them in a video game soundtrack they were then featured in a few commercials and then kinda just faded out. Still a great band kinda upset they never made it really bigI personally prefer Warp Riders. Age of Winters is still great though.Anyone who liked this should check out [Elder - Dead Roots Stirring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mZvARd0hY0)Southern Rock Opera has to be at least a 9/10.> Drive By Truckers - The Dirty South

Ah yeah, that's a good one.  My dad's favorite new band.  He is a Rolling Stones / Allman Brothers kind of guy.Broken Machine is also super fucking goodI think *Shrines* is a lot better of an album but I like this one a lot too, even though it got shredded in reviews. Purity Ring is awesome.

[Here's how I found them and it's still a favourite](https://youtu.be/d0s0XHVUGF0)The Dear* Hunter :) If you haven't yet you should check out 'the receiving end of sirens - between the heart and the synapse'. The lead singer/writer's previous bandHot Damn! is the 10/10! Fuck I miss high school.I fucking love Map Change.THOUGH IT MAY HAUNT US
AND BREAK OUR HEARTS
DEAAAAAAATH CANNOT
TEAR US APART.New junk aesthetic for me.

Another stranger passing, a common dissonance. If life is pointless then point taken sing amen.

A lot of that album just resonated with me immediately. Amazing band. Would be nice if people post something like genre with the album too... makes it easier to find stuff I might be interested inAh, the pikachu cunt strikes again.Boris’s *Pink* while we’re at itI think *What Now* is better, but they're both amazing. The *Echo Mountain Sessions EP* is fantastic as well.Go ahead and give the album 'handmade cities' by Plini a listen. Same progressive style as polyphia but with a more complicated sound. Red always got me.King Gizzard are fucking knocking it out of the park. Oddments and I'm In Your Mind Fuzz are phenomenal albums.

I think Flying Microtonal Banana is still slept upon even by fans. Sleepdrifter and Nuclear Fusion are some of their best songs and they're otherworldly.

And +1 for Cosmogramma.Brockhampton is fucking amazing and they have released like 3 albums in the last 14 months and are getting ready to drop another. They are the perfect recommendation for anyone that likes rap and is trying to binge-listen to music. Obscure though?RATTLESNAKE! RATTLESNAKE! RATTLESNAKE! RATTLESNAKE! RATTLESNAKE! RATTLESNAKE! RATTLESNAKE! RATTLESNAKE! RATTLESNAKE! RATTLESNAKE! RATTLESNAKE! RATTLESNAKE!RATTLESNAKE! RATTLESNAKE! RATTLESNAKE!RATTLESNAKE!RATTLESNAKE!RATTLESNAKE! 

Truly soul reaching lyrics that touch me.Fly lo is obscure?King Gizzard was the first band that came to mind when I saw this thread. It's a completely different vibe, but Paper Mache Dream Balloon is actually my favorite album. Most of their stuff is solid, though.all sorts of metal genres are doing well atm, it's fucking awesome. Recently discoverer Be’Lakor, every album is greatYes, this current scene is the best I can ever remember heavy music being. Great albums out of the wazoo, especially with more extreme metal.Swoon is great.Dude, love Toro y Moi! Cola represent!Shad is so under appreciated These guys kill it live too, saw them open for The Front Bottoms and they had awesome energy!I haven’t heard Twin Fantasy, but Teens of Denial is absolutely fantastic.I like how even OP fucked up on this one.Well, they're doing a 10th anniversary tour for MOF and pretty much the entire thing is sold out, so they have a fairly sizable following. Whether it was majority scalpers, I don't know. ...so you're saying you saw Jeff Rosenstock once and you were drunk and screamed too loud?If it makes you feel better my friend got hammered and sack tapped Jeff at a house show recently. It was very embarrassing.Oh woah ohhh oh oh woah ohhh oh ohBTMI is one of the best things to happen to *that* scene and Jeff is a lovely guy. Really pleased to see he's doing well for himself these days.Pat had a fucking arc.Oh I agree completely. Seeing them live is borderline transcendental. But I dig the album too. In my opinion it's unfair to compare an act's live stuff to their studio stuff because they're almost two different art forms. Some bands are really good at one or the other, but the songs themselves are what make the band good. *tucks shirt*A pinegrove meme? The future is here.The musicality of the lyrics in that song is absolutely incredible. I can think of very few other songs where it really feels like the exact sound of every word chosen is perfect, and probably none where it still manages to convey that much information. Evan just has this great understanding of what his lyrics should actually sound like.I saw your boyfriend at the Port Authority. It's a sort of fucked up place. "Saw Leah on the bus a few months ago. Saw some old friends at her funeral."

Right in the feels.They're also amazing live. I think Elephant Eyelash is also perfect. I mean, Speech Bubbles has the most genius lyrics ever!

My favorite part: "And now these empty breaths reflect
The feedback of headlights
Push leaves and coffee cups
To lower altitudes and gutters
Rain is confession weather
And we become booths of prayer if we let us"

The new album sucks ass tough. But the rest have some pretty good tracks like White English from Mups. Sod in the seed EP is awesome too. And Eskimo Snow has some great tracks like "Against Me" "These Hands" "Into the shadow of my embrace". 

Early Why has some great tracks, genius stuff like "Broken Crow (Reaching quiet version)" and "Bad Entropy" and "21st century pop song (bloody genius)"The rest of the album is that good, trust me.genetics, usuallyCheck out cLOUDDEAD. It's Yoni in addition to Doseone and Odd Nosdam. Emancipator is incredible, I've see his Ensemble live 3 times now and words cannot speak to how amazing they are.

Emancipator Ensemble at red rocks with the Opiuo band was a highlight for me.Holy fuck are you serious???That's his best album. Black sands by Bonobo is similar and also great 

Edit: also Tycho's Epoch album
Edit2: also ODESZA - Summer's Gone 

All are phenomenal That’s prog rock for yaThird eye3 so far, 4th is imminent. Judging by their new single on YouTube, it might be their best one yet I dunno, I feel King Gizz is not that obscure anymore. Might be biased tho.I listen to alot of aggressive music. I always try to get away with playing it in the car when I visit home and we're driving somewhere.

When this album came out I said "New album. Listen to this." She sighed, ready to tell me to turn it off. Then I played *Sprained Ankle*. She loved it.  Rejoice is one of the rawest most passionate songs I've ever heard. Shivers every time.Sour Breath is mine. The album is just so beautiful in every aspect. It just feels so huge when you're listening.Great thing. You have literally days of music to listen to if you jump into his catalogue.

I first thought about recommending Devin himself, but he is way to big nowadays to count as obscure.GIRAFFES? GIRAFFES! - When Catholic Girls Go Camping the Nicotine Vampires Rule Supreme.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZqZCS0rCmE

SO DAMN GOOD

edit: album name is More Skin With Milk-MouthMath rock and midwest emo forever!

I really need to check out TTNG though. It's criminal that I even consider myself a fan of those genres and I haven't ever listened to them. The transition between If this tour doesn't kill you and DVP is something dreams are made of.True Torontonians know this feat is impossible Don’t wish you were dead, wish you’d never been born at all. Yeah I'd be better off dead! I don't give a shit, I just don't wanna die and I don't wanna live, I said...YOU’RE NOT WAKKKKIINNGGGG UPPPPPPMan, that line kicks me in the heart every time. I've had them on repeat for about 6 months at this point and there's no signs of stoppingSomeone posted [Sleep In The Heat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa3Afg3fzAQ) because one of the Stranger Things kids is in it. I've been cutting onions to it ever since.Dark Days is maybe their best song everJust saw them a month or so ago. Great live band!Huh. MB seems like a really chill band. That's too bad.I'm always taken back a little when I see people say Rented World. I've always assumed On the Impossible Past was gonna be everyone's favorite. Rented World was such a musical shift for me since I'd been listening and seeing them since like 2009.


They've been a favorite of mine for a long while but are starting to take a back seat to PUP and Joyce Manor now.Mountain is ridiculously captivating. Falling back to earth has one of my favorite sections ever.*The Human Equation* might be the best in terms of story/theming, but *Into the Electric Castle* will always be my favorite musically. There's just so much to love, it plays like a group of jazz musicians freestyling together to make a hard rock album. Every song is different, and every song is great.If you don't like one of their albums, just listen to a different one and it'll be completely different, thematically.A band I was in opened for them a few years ago. It's the first and only time I've ever seen a band have a legitimate unplanned encore. They finished their set, walked off and everyone just kind of stood around waiting for more. Came back ten minutes later to start tearing down, everyone got riled up and the vocalist was like "...I guess we'll play one more, thanks guys." Then they played An Introduction and I sobbed like a wee baby. I believe Grace for Drowning is his jazziest album but anything from Porcupine Tree to Basscomunnion is always a pleasure to listen to. Steven Wilson is a brilliant artist.True, but there's still a lot of people who don't know about him, and the more exposure he gets; the better.>**Polanski** at Night

heheh.

Seriously though, "I want to see Pulaski at night" is an amazing EP from start to finish.

Watching the video of it is amazing. Shaun Martin taking his headphones off and just shaking his head and laughing makes it for me. It’s so ridiculous that *other world class musicians* can’t handle its ridiculousness. I was bummed they took it off of Spotify Jazz fusion but more on the rock and Latin side of thingsI'm one of the weird people who thinks "After the Party" might be their bestIf Danny Brown counts in this thread, CSH is definitely obscure enough. I never felt it again.Drugs are better than friends are better than drugs are better than friends are better... An instant classic to me.Same for me. Absolutely soul crushing. I can only listen to it every few months. Mount Eerie’s “A Crow Looked at Me” is a strong contender I discovered that album right after my fiance died. In a hospital. After I'd been caring for her, which was difficult. I can't get within ten feet of it now without self-destructing.But make sure you have the lyrics on stand by, kinda hard to understand on the first few listens. Both albums are good but Strange Trails is the one I have to listen to start to finish every time.It kills me because I discovered that album/song a few months ago, and that song devastated me. It immediately reminded me of an ex from years ago and I can't hear it without thinking about her. I had really liked a few of their other songs, Fool For Love being one of my favourites, but The Night We Met was on another level.

Anyway, a couple months later that TV show made it popular and now I've been hearing it randomly everywhere. Not only is it watering the song down for me, but its also not a casual, easy-listening track. Its about that deep, painful melancholic feeling when you lament the loss of a loved one and regret the past. It has some intense, heavy themes and it hits hard. I am not really in the mood to be listening to it when I'm at the god damn CVS.

Regardless, it is incredibly beautiful and although it hurts, I'm really glad I found that song.Yeah I’d say at the time Lonesome Dreams was released they were a bit more obscure than they are now. And yeah that song was featured on that show and they gained some popularity from that. I’d say all of their albums are 10/10 for me! Nick offerman 👌👌There's one thing that's real clear to me:


No one dies with dignityI've seen Jason and his band live twice and both times when he did Cover Me Up I couldn't help but cry a bit.   
  
To put it in context for anyone reading through this thread, it's a song Isbell wrote about his wife Amanda(who plays fiddle with him on tour a lot of the time) and how she basically saved his life and gave him something to live for. During the performance the whole band leaves the stage except her on the nights that she's there, and you can tell he is just pouring his soul out to her. It is one of the most intimate things I've ever seen and probably one of the clearest ways I've ever observed true love.  
  
[Here's a good quality clip of it if you're interested.](https://youtu.be/jm6GXnV7c6E?t=1h6m46s)The first three songs on The Nashville Sounds tell 3 different but related stories about being from the small town south. 

Last of My Kind definitely hits me the hardest as well, because I'm in a similar situation as you. I even grew up on a river in Arkansas like the main character in the song, with a farming family who doesn't farm anymore. It legit caught me off guard the first time I heard it. "Daddy said the river would always lead me home/but the river can't take me back in time/and now he's dead and gone". The thing about LOMK is that it's wistful, but he never mentions actually going home. There's almost like this feeling of having escaped the south, but still missing the south. Especially the way it fades in and then fades out, almost like a memory. 

Then "Cumberland Gap" comes in hard after that. LOMK is wistful, but CG is angry as fuck. The narrator is the polar opposite of the guy in the last song. Fuck that guy, he got out. The guy in CG can't get out. He wants to leave so bad, but he knows he never will. "I've thought about movin away/but what would my mama say?/I'm all that she has left, and I'm with her everyday./As soon as the sun goes down/I make my way to the Mustang Lounge/and if you don't sit facin the window, you could be in any town." The Cumberland Gap has swallowed him up, and he can't get out. So he just gets shitfaced and curses the town he's trapped in. 

Finally, "Tupelo" comes in sweet and delta-y. The narrator, i think, has just gone through a breakup. He's going to finish his "plastic cup of real good wine" and head back home to Tupelo. "If I get out of the hole/I'm going to Tupelo./There's a girl down there that will treat me fair./Get about a week of spring, then the summer is blistering./So there ain't no one from here that will follow me there." The problem is, as he goes on to state in the song, the girl down there probably won't solve his problems. He's overlooking all the bad and creating an amalgam that doesn't exist. "She never lived up to my memories". The thing is, this song is called "Tupelo", not some girl's name. The song could also be about the perceptions of the south from people within it, and their willingness to overlook our problems or pretend they don't exist, and create a romanticized version of ourselves and our home. 

And then he pivots right into "White Man's World". 

The Nashville Sound, to me, is every bit as good as Southeastern. It might be a little more focused, even. "If We Were Vampires" is absolutely heartbreaking, just as much as Elephant. And TNS even has uplifting shit on it, which SE kind of doesn't. lolAs soon as the very first notes of Music Has the Right to Children hit, I know I'm about to be taken to a whole new world. What a fucking masterpiece. Archangel is basically a metal gear solid 2/ray jay mashup as well. dudes massively into games.Gonna see Danny and Lil B at Bruiser Thanksgiving, only been this hyped for a show a few times in my life. Have fun!I first heard him on "Hey Kids" by RTJ and thought "who is this guy and why the fuck would anyone record his voice for repeated listening" but now I love the guy and listen to his shit all the time.Ain’t It Funny scares the heck out of me. It’s so anxiety driven and mad. Pure genius at work. XXX is my favorite from Danny Brown. The emotion he puts into the end of 30 (last song) gives me goosebumps.I loved the music tie in, it shouldn't have worked but was perfect somehow.  He did, the OP, ED(?), and a ton of tracks were done by him.I love nujabes but chillhop was around in the 90's. Cafe del mar, buddha beats and the like. I would argue Moby's smash hit porcelain (1999) was the chillhop anthem for many years. Nah, J Dilla was  a huge influence on Nujabes.

They had the same birthday coincidentally and both died way before their time.Grieve not his passing, luv(sic) made him immortal.if you've listened to instrumental hip hop before (or if you are a weeaboo) there is a 100% chance you've heard himI try to bite my tongue when i see kiddos talkin about obscure nujabes. And about 26,000 EPs whose only flaw is being way too shortIt's so bizarre that Darnielle can be like "okey doke time to write one about the Bible, or hmmmm this time let's do professional wrestling, or maybe this time NO GUITARS" and every single goddamn time it's brilliantSeriously...Tallahassee, Heretic Pride and Life of the World to Come ripped my heart out, glued it back together with glitter glue and violently shoved it back into what was left of the shell of myself. Culture scars felt like hail the sun had to churn out some songs for a label release to me, there's like 4 good songs in my mind from that album. Wake every song is perfectI jack off to that EPMagma was a phenomenal albumThe drumming on low lands between the kick and hi-hat is amazing. So simple sounding, but impossible (for me) to play. For the average metal fan, Gojira is super mainstream but I suppose outside that it could be considered obscure. Context, I guess. Gojira is considered a popular band and is banned on /r/metal. Love, Ire, & Song, and England Keep My Bones are his masterpieces.ctrl f: "england keep". upvote.Let's stop foolin' around!A minute in this thread and I've already seen Hotelier, Antlers, and Mom Jeans. Wtf is happening?I heard the new tour is in celebration of said album and they will be playing it in its entirety. 

That means that every set ends with White Walls. Dope. 

Lions Roar is better IMHO but it's all goodSaw them open for Coheed having never heard of them before. Absolute 10/10. They put so much into their performance. Anyone who loves The Dear Hunter should also check out Casey's first band, The Receiving End of Sirens. They should be on this list too, especially their album Between the Heart and the Synapse.I agree wholeheartedly /r/TheDearHunterCarpenter Brut is probably what I've listened to most over the past couple of weeks. Just found out about him a couple weeks ago lol.CTRL+F Carpenter Brut... Ma Man.I agree.  I like synthwave, but I feel a lot of the synthwave artists are really using a formula on how to sound - leading them to sound really generic and uninspired.  I heard Tech Noir and heard real artistry and creativity.  I loved it.  That album is so good.Same but I'd list Art Angels as the 10/10 one myselfEy mate, not to be pedantic but Classics is the album, Loud Pipes is the track.

Their new stuff is solid too, if you haven't heard I highly recommend.

[Cream on Chrome](https://youtu.be/xlcywgEMuGI) is probably the most popular off of Magnifique.Sorry has got to be my most overplayed song the past few monthsI've watched that gif many times, pretty sure you can't see pikachu's cunt but I guess I'll check again. There is some amazing black metal around as well.

Free download on their website Theyre still pretty obscure, they're hardly known outside of the psychedelic scene. I'd say any artist that are almost exclusively known only by people who are into whatever their genre is still counts as somewhat obscure, but I do agree that they're not at all obscure within the psychedelic scene. Hell, at this point they're getting to be almost as big as groups like Tame ImpalaIn-fucking-deed. Plus the video for DVP is so good.Don Valley Parking LotDoing 20 on the Dom valley parkwayShe says I drink too much, Hawaiian red fruit punchI want you to know thay I'd spend every bit of my pitiful savings and loans just to see you again, but I know I won't.I can't listen to this song anymore since my cat died, otherwise I just end up crying big ugly tears.For me it's the line, "I'm trying my best but you can't even look at me or talk to me or tell me what's happening to you."

https://youtu.be/aa3Afg3fzAQIf you haven't passionately sang it out loud into a mirror when no one else is home and then broke down into tears and immediately started hugging your dog, have you even listened to it at all?It could have been an off night. PUP was the definite crowd favorite. Agreed. But it's fun watching their recording sessions on YouTubeThat opening track, "Death is Real," had me absolutely weeping. Anyone that has gone through the loss of someone close to them, especially a family member, will be really affected by that album. That being said, it is beautiful.I lost my mom suddenly this year and subsequently moved in with my dad.  You can really tell when I'm having a bad day based of of my Spotify activity.  The three albums that have been having the heaviest rotation are:

* Mount Eerie - A Crow Looked at Me
* Sufjan Stevens - Carrie and Lowell
* Sun Kil Moon - Benji

Each one is absolutely devastating.Not to diminish the impact the album had on you, but it's all a metaphor for a dying relationship. That's what made the album go from melodramatic to *holy shit* for me"how did meatwad get a verse on this rtj track?"Shinichiro Watanabe, is a genius with musical direction. He'd already struck gold with combining music and anime in Cowboy Bebop.Yeah, but I think the percentage of people that have listened to instrumental hip hop is pretty small compared to those that listen to mainstream artists. I guarantee nobody in my office of 10 people have heard of him despite us having pretty different tastes in music.He's inspired a whole genre of music and artists. Definitely far from obscure.I never thought I could love an album about wrestling so much. The Legend of Chavo Guerro is one of my favorite MG songs.my wife and i went through some hard times due to my depression and the fact we've been together since highschool and never really knew love other than each other. we have since fixed some major issues and our relationship is stronger than ever, but i still can't listen to "no children" or really all of tallahassee for that matter. goddamn, that guy expressed in words what i never could- or maybe was afraid to- express myself. john darnielle is amazing. greatest songwriter of this generation, hands down. Secret Wars EP is awesome, if you haven't caught it yet. Released on Friday.AND LETS TURN THIS BAND INTO A LEAN, MEAN, MOM JEANS REVENGE MACHINE! 

Holy fuck, I NEVER thought I would see Mom Jean on Reddit.  One of my favorite fucking bands lately.My only regret is that I was too late to this thread to whore out my own favorites.

I'll do it here.

Opportunities by Hot Mulligan.

Incredible emo-influenced midwest pop punk EPYou heard right.  Saw them in Boston in September and they played Colors front to back with maybe one small break in the middle to talk to the crowd.  

They also came back for an encore and played Mordecai which was awesome.  10/10 show, would go see again.  I'm actually wearing my Colors 10th Anniversary Tour hoodie today!Casey is amazing. So much fun live.Thank God for unexpected r/TheDearHunterTheir Maniac cover is fucking great, glad I witnessed it live.This is my favorite thread on Reddit.It’s weird seeing you outside of the subreddit. not at 3 a.m.  She says I need to grow up And this is where I start crying when I'm at the gym.

They have a little studio on the tour bus with a UAD apollo. Amazing service.Holy shit that song had me sobbing 

"Crusted with tears, catatonic and raw

I go downstairs and outside and you still get mail

And the characters are amazing I only make active-aggressive comments. I hate you and I need you to know that.C'mon bud, the circle ain't gonna jerk itself. We here on reddit merge at speed and signal ahead of time, every time.

Also, People who chew their gum like loud, obnoxious cows, why do you hate everyone?My favorite askreddit post ever was "People who take 15 minutes at the ATM, what are you doing?"  or similar.

I don't make passive aggressive posts... unlike some people.So I'll have something to do while I'm merging onto the highway at 30 miles per hour.The thing I hate is the totally one-sided story that is clearly designed to elicit a sympathetic response. Sorry, but I don't know you. There are two sides to every story, also you could just be making this up, for all I know. Same reason they do on facebook or twitter.

They want the world to know what they think, and that it's really, really important.

Edit:  A post about why people make posts that accomplish nothing, is my highest-upvoted post of all time.  I guess you can probably answer this yourself now!How should someone properly vent about a completely insignificant inconvenience that they are butthurt about?Do any posts on /r/Askreddit accomplish anything?Because fuck you, that's why.I learned it from Facebook.To make a better circlejerk than /r/circlejerkI find that redditors love to assume the worst, and that 50% of my posts will be interpreted as passive aggressive even if that requires assuming exactly the opposite of what I meant. I can agree with a person, and they'll proceed to explain why I am wrong.A pessimist gets to always be right.  When someone posts an "unpopular opinion", either they find others who will agree or they choose to interpret downvotes\disagreement as proof that they're just more perceptive than everyone else.  Cynicism feeds off a feeling of righteous indignation.

There's no risk of rejection in it, but the downside is that the unconventional perspective won't be taken as seriously as someone who can speak with sincerity about a topic they feel is important.To bring attention that people still declaw cats. Passive-aggressive Askreddit posts are my biggest pet peeve. Absolutely condescending and annoying.I once tried to make an r/Askreddit post asking if ANY women actually enjoy unsolicited dick pics. If so, why?

The worst recent offender is the: "DAE hate it when people drive too slowly on highway on/off ramps?" post that's currently on the front page.

 You people are the worst ducking type of people."No matter how flat the pancake, there's always two sides." - Dr. Phil

(I quote that whenever I can because it's literally the shittiest analogy I've ever heard)Reminds me of a gf I had. We’d been broken up for months when she showed up at my apt to “break up” with me, all while her friend sat in her car. We’re in our 30’s and she maintained this relationship lie, that we hadn’t broken up and I’d been cheating on her, for months and most of her friends and family believed her. 


Now I’m all paranoid when I hear breakup stories because it seems so damn easy to lie. Plenty of people do lie to make themselves sound better or get sympathy. It's so easy to do it online, when all you have to do is sound somewhat convincing and sympathetic.

I think about that sometimes when I read a story on Reddit that feels a little off. After all, I don't know these people, I wasn't there for the situation, and I'm only getting one person's side. I don't try to call anyone out or anything, it's just something I keep in the back of my mind.My mom threw my son off a balcony and doesn’t talk to me anymore. She loves my brother more than me and is the worst person ever.

I tried but last Christmas/Easter/thanksgiving/kwanza was the worst when she did (fill in most evil shit ever) 

Edit . Thanks for the support and raised by narcissists link!!!!![deleted]The staple of this place. Somehow everyone on reddit is faultless in every conflict in their lives.This reminds me of the time me and my cousin were hunting big foot in the rocky mountains.

My cousin swore he saw the fucker and took a shot but cause the guy was so drunk what he was really shooting at was me. Bunch of buckshot right up my poop shoot, if you catch my drift.

Anyways long story short I don't talk to my mother anymore.Those craziest exes stories I read on askreddit... yea I'm going to have to hear it from their side.Every time I hear one of those "Management is fucking bullshit, my friend was late one time after working there for twenty years and they fired him on the spot" followed by a bunch of teenagers talking about how labor law sucks in the US and Europeans sucking each other's cocks about how that would *never* happen over there.

Meanwhile, all I know is that we are hearing one side of the story, and that one side is full of shit.omg, i was fired from this last job because my coworkers and manager all disliked for no reason. And get this...the manager actually had the nerve to schedule a meeting with me to talk about my "bad" attitude and tell me all about all these complaints that everyone in an entire department conspired to make up just to make me look bad. She even told me that she was going to give me a second chance to shape up which I know is just her way of telling me that she wanted me gone. I don't understand what's wrong with these people, I'm clearly a better employee than everyone else (including my stupid manager whose job I can do 10x better...something I like to hint at to her every day), they're just jealous Oh man, that hits home, my uncle is a big liberal and his wife is a republican. I can’t tell you how many posts I’ve seen about how trump is the reason their healthcare sucks. It’s all pretty subtle, but I’m sure it’s directed at her.His may be to some degree more effective considering his target audience is entirely composed of redditors.This whole post is horseshit I posted this exact [same](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7fx9x7/people_who_post_passive_aggressive_questions_to/) thing like 6 hours ago!

Edit: Time to post a "People who make passive-aggressive posts on reddit about passive aggressive-posts on Reddit, I'm jealous."/r/rantYell at your windshiled like a normal person?make a youtube channel.Become a politician?r/lifeprotips like everyone else.They get you karma, the only thing that really matters in life I am unaware if this is a joke, but some answers can be quite entertaining and informative to read.Do any of our actions accomplish anything, in the end?

But yeah, so many redditors seem unable to have a conversation unless they are telling someone why they’re wrong. Every cat declawing thread is also 15% circumcision. The worst part, IMO, are the sincere responses that get downvoted to hell. Because we wouldn’t want any genuine understanding impinging on our circlejerk now.for me it's passive aggressive anything, life's too short to be a martyrI'd wager it's men projecting their own feelings.

Mostly it's fun to see what a guy has. 90% of the time it's a boring dick and it's fun to see a guy try to play it up. If we've been talking about hooking up or meeting, it lets me know what to expect. Plus I do enjoy seeing dicks. At the end of the day, I don't feel like it's some huge burden or inconvenience. I can ignore it like I would any other message. 

I do feel bad though that I might be encouraging men to do it to other women though. Presumably it was removed to stop you getting flooded with dick picsIdk. I certainly don't want an unsolicited vag pic so why why would anyone want the opposite. I wouldn't mind some tits every now and again but who wouldn't?

Edit: 2 days later and still no pics PM'd to me. Reverse psychology is a lie.I'm a gay guy, and I'd enjoy receiving them. Dicks are part of the body; there's no harm in it. Some are even pretty fun to look at.

Send 'em my way, losers. I'll find a compliment for ya.I enjoy showing a girlfriend and giggling at it. Not a turn on though. Yes because the lanes are so *fucking* short!I think the difference here is that the people that go 30 on the on ramp probably don't come to reddit, while the people that passive-aggressive ask shit are the only people who come to reddit.finallyCanada and Europe are utopias in the eyes of Reddit.

People want to feel validated and superiorPretty sure OP knows their post is also passive aggressive, the irony is part of the joke. It is a call out but it’s also tongue-in-cheek.But then I have to sift through "New".  I'd rather just complain and let other people do it for me.I’m a fan of *active-passive*, myself. It’s got a certain nonsensical hum to it.

Since I live in an apartment complex, I park facing someone else's bedroom window, so I make sure that my headlights are on, because I like the way their curtains look in my HID headlights.

Then, since i drive a stick, I try to shift into reverse, gun it to chirp my tires (helps them warm up), forget about reverse lockout so I'm actually in first, drive forward as fast as possible on accident, and crash into my neighbors bedroom. Then I get out because I forgot to grab the coffee cup I put on top of my car, back up, and go to my job at Comcast Customer Service.

You're welcomeThat's the answer to all frustrating Reddit experiences. People are fucking stupid.I can't believe I got a poem! I've seen a few of your things around the site.

Thank you.I look forward to finding your poems hidden across reddit :) Thank youYou're my favourite redditor to spot in the wild.What fowl language. Doctor Phil is what happens when you give Foghorn Leghorn a tv talk show. 

Edit: Thanks for the gold! It's a good anology.  The stories may be similar (as in how close each side of a pancake is), but they're still different (each side of a pancake is different).


It's better than some name brand analogies like "a watched pot never boils" (it does.  I checked).But it's true, and an apt analogyI don't get it... why is that analogy shitty? A pancake does have two sides :/"Haha, I've foiled you with my mobius pancake, Dr. Shill!"My ex started dating before telling her family we'd broken up. (She'd got a head start in choosing suitors before the relationship ended.) Inevitably, she lied about where she was and the lie broke too. It ended with her mum reporting her missing to the police and a manhunt before she returned home.

But that's just, like, my opinion man.Sorry, but I don't know you. There are two sides to every story, also you could just be making this up, for all I know. This. After hearing how an ex spun the story of our breakup, I take all the 'my ex is a terrible person' stories with a grain of salt.In my mid to late 20s had a girl stop talking to me after a year and a halfish. Two weeks of that and, fine that's done. started dating someone else. Only to find out I was apparently cheating on her the whole time. That had some interesting reactions in the our extended friend group. Half had heard she wouldn't talk to me and I found a fun rebound and half heard I'm the devil. She stopped showing up at events after it all kinda floated around a bit. No one wanted to get stuck in some drama of hers. Two people are married now because I got with her, so at least there's that.I tend to believe pretty much every story I read on reddit/the internet by default, unless there is an obvious red flag. I think it's because I'd never make something up, so I don't immediately imagine someone else would.

I was reading an old thread on here about plane accidents recently. Someone posted a quite long, detailed, very believable story about being on a plane when something happened that punctured the wing. I read it open mouthed, and he sounded like a decent chap, giving interesting details about how he felt, not making it too melodramatic. Then under all the comments saying 'omg how awful you poor thing'' etc, he basically said 'haha you stupid assholes for believing that, this is the internet anyone can make up any dumbshit and here you are believing it.' No idea what he got out of that but I just thought... fuck you. The vast majority of people aren't weird sociopathic liars, so I will continue to read interesting stories and assume they're true. I'm not believing that cabbage soup cures cancer or that the man really has sweets and puppies in his van. I would lose out more by being super sceptical about every single cool story I read than I would by being wide eyed and credulous and getting taken in by a lie  every so often. The way I look at is that why not take the story at face value when considering how to respond. They either made it up for internet points, in which who cares? The person is here to vent in which does it really matter if they're stretching the truth, it's not like we are in a trial where the other person gets prosecuted on the testimony given. Or they are looking for advice, in which I will ask for clarification if I think the other party might have a different perspective or try to get them to consider alternative narratives but after that if they don't want to present the story objectively then it's on because they're only making the advice they receive less helpful and less relevant.

That being said, don't let someone's easily fabricated story significantly alter you world view without sufficient fact checking, but in conversation with the person I just let it ride.I personally can't stand the /r/gaming posts that are like "I have cancer but I Just bought this Nintendo® Switch" and then it's literally just a picture of a switch box. A) I'm convinced it's marketing and they know Reddit eats that shit up because apparently sympathy upvotes make you a good person and B) even if the person does have cancer it's such a low effort post> My mom threw my son off a balcony and doesn’t talk to me anymore.

Son was the anti-Christ who was summoning demons in the house. They don't pay rent, don't turn on the exhaust when they shit and always cut you off mid-sentence.>I tried but last Christmas/Easter/thanksgiving/kwanza was the worst when she did

...me in the ass with a strapon and then my wife walked in on us and opened her mouth like she was about to start yelling but my mom said "Shut the fuck up you stupid whore" and pulled the strapon out of my ass and jammed it in my wife's mouth and to make a long story short my wife moved in with my mom because she said the strapon felt more real than my tiny dick ever had and now she gets DPd by both my parents daily and I lost my house You forgot the obligatory "Am I overreacting?"I think most of skepticism of these types of stories comes from the fact that actual Narcissistic Personality Disorder is quite rare, and people who do have it are often quite good at hiding it from people that they don't have power over.

This means that most people have never witnessed the batshit crazy side of an NPD person, so when they see someone being called a narcissist on the internet they itnerpret it as simply "selfish" or "self centered".

I've had the pleasure of witnessing some real narcissist in action, and a "mom my threw my son off a balcony" type of story does not at all seem far fetched to me.I looked up from my pile of pizza boxes, excess weight, and 72 hour marathon gaming session in the middle of my six months of unemployment to find out my horrible bitch/bastard partner left me for shallow reasons like this other person *listens to them* and *finds them attractive* and *cares about their needs* just tossing aside everything I have ~~put them through~~ been through with them. Unconditional love my ass.  The stuff that usually makes me roll my eyes is when tons of people bitch about others not using turn signals, not knowing how to merge into traffic stuff like that.

These fuckers are the same ones that have done that shit too. I think it's because of the way it comes across, sparks a chain of comments where everyone piles on with their anecdote that sounds high and mighty while any of us could give two shits about it lol.>*We judge ourselves based on our motives,  we judge others on their actions.*Capitalism man *rips joint and turns on the XBox* ಠ_ಠ

I think I shall steal this story and use it to fend off offers of polite social situations I cannot avoid otherwise.When I hear that someone has been with a shitty bf/gf for year+ (assuming no kids/imprisonment), I usually blame OP. 

I don't trust the story of people who love the attention of being in a dramatic relationship, plus I'm an asshole.  

"Dating a year.  She/he breaks my stuff and has cheated on me twenty eight times with my best friend, once in the bed I built with my own hands for us and then she/he fucked my brother/sister in the car she/he made me buy him/her. She/he evil, feel sorry for me"

No.  I wish each Reddit "douchebag story" type of post had the reverse, with the "douchebag" talking.I fired an employee for no showing on her shift not once, not twice, but THREE times. It was overnights and guess who had to work those shifts that she missed? She then has the audacity to give us a 1-Star google review with no comment. We replied that she was an ex-employee and reported it but of course google doesn't do shit. Then she replies to our reply 6 months later saying how poorly we treated her and how terrible management was. It was a big sob story that was a couple paragraphs long that call out managers by name. She was a good employee when she was working. Hell we let her watch netflix, browse the web, study, do whatever since it was a "warm body" position but we are the assholes? All she had to do was SHOW UP! Sorry for ranting but this stuff really pulls at me and I can't help but be cynical of every reddit "woe is me" post. Look in to zero hour contracts in the EU.

A lot of service industry jobs are this and they don't fire you they just stop giving you hours.reddit blames everything on   

- older people   

- conservatives   

- wealthier people Sounds like a precursor to a good hate-fuck.I would love to watch a sitcom based on their day to day interactions.What? The target audience of every AskReddit post is redditors!Shows you how a subtle change to a title can make all the differenceYour title seemed more like you were personally scorned. The irony was too real. This title, however, has a more humorous subtext. r/antAnd if you want to be philosophical about it, /r/Kant You spelled windshield wrongWhat about gold though?Yeah seriously, a lot of them are interesting or funny. These other posts that are just a forum for someone to complain about something never contain comments in either of those categories. Definitely belong somewhere else.Now kith. r/theydidthefuckyouMay we all get fucked on this blessed day.Yeah this has fucked me up in forum posting, ahhh scared i must escape this hellI had some guy call me a troll, retard, idiot, fanboy, and block me because I told him he can't demand to have something right now if it doesn't exist/ isn't compete. I even agreed that I was annoyed it was not complete and think it should already be done. He seemed to think I was defending the company, giving legit reasons that it was not done and then I tried to make up stuff when I "realized" I was wrong. You're fucking wrong dude, there's way more redditors who are able to have a conversation without telling someone they're wrong. You're just trying to push your own narrative with an anecdote!

Edit. Also, I feel personally attacked by your statement because of how wrong it is. Also, "/s". I've gotten in trouble for not adding that beforeOk, cut or uncut, each have their own charm.  But 15% circumcised sounds downright ugly!"That you're attracted to" is kind of key there. Also, the female equivalent of your typical unsolicited dick pic would just be a close up picture of a vagina. I don't know too many dudes who'd be especially stoked to receive a picture like that from a rando.[deleted]I feel like someone probably messaged you with one now that you've said this Interesting. For me it is definitely an aesthetic thing. I think a nice dick is a beautiful thing, and I love to see them. A beautiful dick for me is a lovely and rare find and can turn me on so much. I do enjoying watching guys jerk off and especially cum a lot too. Pretty sure this is a RIP inbox momentIn all honestly, I opened that link thinking that the people who do that are not on reddit and not going to answer if they doCanada? Europe in general? When did reddit stop sucking Scandinavian dick specifically? The worst part about Canada is my fellow Canadians constantly tugging on people's sleeves to start conversations about how great Canada is.

We have a cringy national inferiority complex.

I hope you can live with yourself!Comcast Customer Service sounds like it would be an awesome job actually; you just provide useless non-information all day, don't bother to actually help anyone, and get paid for it.Some cars like the Subaru BRZ have reverse to the left of 1st gear. Some cars, like the Subaru WRX I actually drive, have reverse to the right of 6th gear. It's not implausible, but it isn't true. But I'm throttling your speeds because you disagreed with me once we repeal net neutrality. Thank you for being a loyal Comcast customer.I know we are all 'aven a laugh, but actually the reverse lockout can do that. Take a 2005 scion tc for example. The reverse is in the 1st gear position and you have a lift a collar thats around the stick until it clicks, then move it into first. If you fail to get the collar up amd you are rushing  (as you might be, trying to burn out backwards) you will let the clutch out right into burning firstShit it is in my Jetta, you know how damn stupid I felt (as if I needed the help) driving off the dealer lot and gently rolling forward towards the showroom? Reverse is left and up, and if you don't press the shifter down, you go real nicely right into first.He needed to fake the snakeIt's because we're sick of his creative bullshit

I want to thank you for making laugh the fucking hardest I have in a few years mate>It's better than some name brand analogies like "a watched pot never boils" (it does.  I checked).

If you blinked it doesn't count because you weren't watching the whole time.

For the sake of science you need to get one of those gadgets like in A Clockwork Orange that holds your eyes open."A watched pot never boils" is an idiom meaning that time will be perceived to be moving slower/endlessly if you focus on the thing you're waiting for, better to do something else in the meantime and time will (be perceived to) pass faster. It's not an analogy.A watched pot never boils isn't an analogy, it's hyperbole. The saying literally applies to boiling water in a pot, and while incorrect, it isn't what I'd call wrong.But we already had, “Every coin has two sides.” Which makes more sense, considering the different sides of coins are usually more distinct than pancake sides. I naturally assume /u/pinkseclusion thought the analogy was foolish, because a pancake does not always have only two sides, if it was **launched into space with sufficient size (probably over 700km wide) and given enough time it would establish hydrostatic equilibrium and settle into a spherical shape with no sides at all.**

Naturally.Some people refer to that as a relationship monkey.  Like a monkey swinging through the trees, not letting go of a branch until there's another one to grab on to - Not letting go of a relationship until there's another relationship to grab on to.  That’s amazing You’re right, we’re actually happily married now. IMO, if a girl stops talking to you after two weeks, you're effectively broken up.I tend to ignore the r/AskReddit replies that read like /r/WritingPrompts. The long, impeccably formatted, super detailed and relevant stories that always have replies like "You should be a writer!". Maybe thats because they *are* a writer. Plot twist: there was no story about an airplane. He made up the story about reading a made up story!Hey, thanks for being an awesome person and with a great outlook. :)What do they possibly get out of doing that? So pathetic and sad. I like to assume they are real too. Wide eyed and bushy tailed with ya.If I’m giving advice, I assume what the person is saying is true, but only *from their perspective*. If they talk about how someone else feels or their motivations, I always keep in mind those could be perceived incorrectly. 
I also don’t get emotionally invested in online “sob stories” or “revenge porn”.TIL all three of my kids are demons summoned by the anti-christ.Happens to the best of us. The Aristocrats!Hey man, I'm sorry to hear that. I know I'm just an internet stranger but if you ever need anything at all, even just a shoulder or an ear,  shoot me a PM.

Good vibes your way man, you're stronger than you thinkSheesh not even a reach around?Damn. You don't know how much mental turmoil is going in your head when you keep asking that to yourself-"Am I overreacting?"- again and again. 

You keep telling yourself you are on the good side, your parents keep telling you how you are an asshole for abandoning them,society shits on you for abandoning your parents. At the end of the day,everything feels like your fault,but you don't wanna keep doing the same shit anymore Sometimes when you're in a room full of farts, you need someone to tell you to step outside for a moment before you can really see how much everything stinks. "Sorry mom, I can't come to your dinner party this weekend because I am still picking buckshot out of my ass from the last time I saw cousin Jimmy"

I feel this one would be best used if you have no cousin Jimmy and hang up directly after. This happens on the relationships subreddit on the rare, glorious occasion. Someone will come along with the usual "my SO steals my money and doesn't do any chores and they kicked my dog", to a chorus of "wow that's awful!" and "this is straight up abuse!" and "break up with them immediately!"

Then: "Hi, SO here. OP showed me this thread because they wanted me to see how many people agreed that I was terrible. I 'steal their money' because they hadn't paid their share of the utilities since March. I haven't tidied this week because they refuse to do anything around the house and it's a last ditch effort to make them realise how unfair the situation is on me. The 'dog kicking' incident was when I accidentally sat on out pomeranian on the couch because I didn't see it."

At least The Garden has breadsticks. Applebees is like going out to pay someone to make you a microwave dinner. Surely there was somewhere that wasn't a chain. Did you just have an epiphany that these askreddit questions are the epitome of passive-aggression?I got stood up on Valentine's Day at a restaurant and it stopped me from throwing an angry fit at her about it.

I got there and waited and waited and when she didn't reply to any texts it was "Oh." You can hardly freak out at a restaurant and I decided to just eat the frustration away anyways. After food I felt better.

I'd imagine a breakup would be similar.Harder to have an angry meltdown in front of people having dinner.

Blink and ~~you're dead~~ your pot boils.Its used specifically as an analogy though, unless someone is actually staring at a pot of water on the stove.But that doesn't sound folksy enough for the people who watch daytime TV¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ It was several years ago, I've since found someone who I am madly in love with. May all the shitty exes find some way to their own happiness, far away from me.There are a disturbing amount of relationship monkeys. Some people cannot exist unless they’re in a relationship. Their whole personality revolves around needing someone else. It’s bizarre but they’re out there. I knew a girl from work several years ago who was never out of a relationship for more than a month but would go through men several times a year. Always had one lined up soon after the previous. She’d never been single for more than a month since she was 16. This makes me sad because about 2 months ago I’d broken up with a girl who I’d been going out with for about 6 months (which felt like a long time), and she keeps doing little things to get back in touch with me. She even got her friends to talk to me. I still care about he and all, and I hope for the best, but she’s really self destructive sometimes and I hope she’ll be okay if she finds out that I’ve been talking to other girls.And you're *still* cheating on her? That woman needs to march over to your house and break up with you. Preferable in 3 months' time.Kinda where everyone settled on the matter. She abandoned a relationship in one of the shittiest ways possible and then tried to play the victim to save face.The writing isn't even *that* good, a lot of the time...As well as the really funny stories that reads like a sitcom scene.Summon demon: Casting time 9 months, 1d8 spawn erupt into this plane of existence, summoning circle is destroyed. *salutes*I knew you would be in here somewhere.

I think we're all going to call it Stabblebees now.This is quite possibly my favorite comment everI went to an Applebee’s outside of Atlanta, I was working really late and it was basically the only place by my hotel that was open.

Do they still have half priced stabbletizers?I call it Craplebee’s re: see aboveHah, someone got execution-style [murdered](http://6abc.com/police-make-arrest-in-nj-applebees-murder/2671066/) at the Applebees in my town.

(also I always knew I was right to hate Applebees)Nice!  We have a Target store on the "bad" side of town that my wife was involved in a hit-and-run in the parking lot and our friend also got carjacked there.  That Target is now referred to as Targhetto.Applebee's used to be ok in a pinch. But the last time I went there, service was hella slow and everything tasted like the same bland, oily, starchy mess. I don't plan on going back ever.It's 'The Garden' now? We need a shorthand for The Olive Garden? That's how fundamental they are...Fuck it. If someone wanted me to pick between Olive Garden and Applebee's, I'd pick Applebee's. At least I can get a quesadilla burger, instead of regreting spending 15 dollars on tomato sauce, pasta, and like 2 meatballs. 'Tour of Italy' my ass. More like a 20 minute bus ride of Italy. Interesting fact: many dishes at The Olive Garden are actually microwaved.

The only epiphany I’ve had regarding Reddit is that I am completely unoriginal.So you're saying arrange a dump-date and then don't go to save myself the bother and they'll get the message and still have a good time?

A fate worse than deathI think the analogy is supposed to be "constantly checking on something won't make it go faster". But I think the nuance is lost to a lot of people, along with "there are starving children in Africa who would love to eat that food!"It's a hyperbolic metaphor. It's saying that time passes faster if you're distracted. If you sit and stare at a pot, it does indeed seem to take a long time to boil. It's a fine saying.One of the most under appreciated character traits these days is loyalty. When you find a partner who is loyal it's life changing. Never having to question or even wonder about your partner's faithfulness is amazing. Preach! 🙌I agree.  I wouldn't be able to bring myself to do it.

It's a fantastic tool.Not everyone is as laid back as I am. I wouldn't recommend this strategy.Yeah, different levels of commitment. If you have a go-to restaurant your relationships probably don't last all that long.I once broke off a 3-year LTR at a Denny's. It was our weekly tradition to have dinner there because of our schedules and I didn't plan the break up, it just came out. Totally pulled the "let's be friends" card and never spoke to each other again.[deleted]Well look who showed up. It’s Dorothy Parker, back from the dead.

Hey, Fuck you I signal in my f150. It's just broken and doesn't flash.I like to call them "Air mixers." That's what the wedge shape is for. 

Because why the hell else would you drive down the highway at 80 mph getting 8 mi/gallon? "I buy 60 bucks in gas every week to stir up the air." People don't buy trucks to carry cargo, I can tell you that much. 

I mean, you basically need a V-8 to drive that fast in a truck, the drag coefficient is so terrible.

They're just mixing up the air for everybody else. 

You don't want to have any lumpy air.The blinkers are the cheap part. It’s the fluid that gets you.Not directly, it just has a low drop rate from loot boxes. It's why bmw drivers who can signal feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. I actually have no idea what you're sayingAmen my brother!I admit, I've done it. Took me about 6 months to get over it myself. It was a freak occurance. I still somehow unbelievably get on with my ex. She's a fantastic woman, as is my current partner. My current partner and I have something truly special though. My ex was like my best friend.

During.Trent Reznor was so moved by Johnny Cash’s version of hurt that he decided to go to The Olive Garden in Times Square because they give him free meals. Jet fuel can’t melt steel nailsSo 9/11 was a NINside job?I'm glad he's okay, because his misfortune really lightened up my night. I used to work at Dennys overnight and crazy shit always went down.

... you name it!Most restaurants have mood lighting to some degree though except for diners.So Chili's putting in those bright ass LEDs means their food is super good??Exactly. Microwaves aren't inherently evil or a direct indication of poor quality food. They should a bigger problem with pre-packaged or pre-portioned, reheat-able meals. People just associate microwaves with TV dinners or leftovers. I still think Fridays, Applebees, Olive Garden are all garbage but just want to defend out humble friend the microwave for a second.Sorry, too late. I'm already not at the restaurant.I’m getting mixed signals from you, I think we should go to Applebee’s How dare you!

I was going steady with her for at least 3 weeks.
It is convenient if executed properly. In situations where you need the reverse gear, you also need the first gear to go into the forward direction again. There is no doubt that making it easy to switch between them is convenient. On my BMW it's pretty much the same Layout. To get in the reverse, you have to press the stick a little harder to the left than for the first gear. It's impossible when in motion and doesn't really happen on accident when standing since the force required to do it is quite high compared to normal shifting. Believe me, it's nothing more than a few drives and you are used to it, its comfortable :)


OP had a mini, pretty safe to say it's the same system.Thanks for the quality comment, Tripleshotlatte.r/prequelmemes has had the high ground for a while now. I'm going to go buy a tiny truck and wait for the fun to start!They say past a three inch lift, every extra inch is making up for a half inch downstairs.Of course, there's no practical application of a big truck that can haul heavy loads...

It’s the return of the, oh hey oh wait buscemi,   He didn’t just put out all those fires again did he?
And all the haters said, nothing you idiots, all the haters are dead too much respect for buscemi

Feminist buscemi volunteerin and winnin, chicka chicka

Yeah I probably got buscemi up in my head lose
But no worse that what went down when the towers fell dude
Sometimes I want to let him out but he will get loose and he can’t or he’ll come for the rest of you too
Buscemi in your lips, buscemi on your lips 
And if he’s lucky you might just give him respect he gets
And that’s the message he delivers when he goes in, and expects to be commended for all of the things he did
Of course they gonna know buscemi fortunately by the time they hit fourth grade they got buscemi live channel don’t they?

We ain’t nothin but randoms, well some of us can hope to meet buscemi and end up running his fan club
And if we can hope for that you know there’s no reason buscemi and another fan can’t elope
And if you feel like I feel I’ve got the antidote 
Get buscemi and you know sing his praise wherever you go

He’s buscemi the real Steve buscemi and all the other buscemis are just imitating so won’t the real buscemi please stand up.> Laughing out load.

I just usually moan, but if you laugh, good for you!That's where Steve Buscemi eats! He was a volunteer firefighter at the ATM near the on-ramp to the 911 freeway.Omg dying rnWe were glad too, he's a good guy. He was laughing about it already when we all left.

Probably I didn't notice the extra force required because at the time my family car was an OG Fiat Panda 4x4, and everything about that car is hard as nails.

Nailed it.

&nbsp;&nbsp; - My Brain probablyDon't lewd the tendies!YesIf you eat at the Olive Garden in Times Square call 911! Steve Buscemi will show up to hurt Trent Reznor and Johnny Cash.   interesting fact! the 911 freeway was named after September 11th, 1945, the day Russia surrendered in the Civil War, the bloodiest war America has ever seen. Is it true that Steve Buscemi has existed on a strict diet of garlic bread sticks since 9/11?User name checks out.Okay now I’m curious. When you say stabbed, do you mean violently while in an altercation, or perhaps did a knife fall off a plate and stab him in the hand?Y'all just walked away from the incident? That's ballsy for real. Y'all are boss. Any 24-hour diner is in a different category altogether. Shit goes down in Waffle House at 3am.

From the dust, a challenger emerges Paying invoices late, especially BIG companies that pay a few months late.

Also I just wish that it would be mandatory schedule length of at least two weeks if the hours are not the same evety day. Mine changes weekly, and it's hard to plan anything. Using a previous salary against you.

"Oh, you make $40,000? Well, we'll offer you $50,000. That's a 25% increase in pay!"

Your salary shouldn't be relative, it should be what the market value of the position is. If a job pays $75,000, don't pay me only $50,000 because I only currently make $40,000. Making you pay more for printing your own damn tickets at home. 

StubHub, ticketmaster etc.Using your employment as leverage to keep your mouth shut.

For example. A temp agency i worked through tried to deduct the cost of ppe from my paycheck. I told them that legally, employers need to provide ppe to their employees. Not sell it to them. They threatened to fire me. I reported them to OSHA. They got fined and had to reimburse everyone their $15 deduction for ppe. 

Temp agencies are fucking scams.
EDIT: PPE: "Personal Protective Equipment." Hard hat, safety glasses, gloves, steel tipped boots, etc.

EDIT: I listed Steel toe boots as an example of PPE, but employers aren't necessarily required to provide steel tipped shoes. Most employers will reimburse the cost of them, though, for regular employees. Not so much for temps. The sort of things that need to be supplied would be protective headware, eyewear, gloves, etc. Not too sure about ear protection, but my employeer supplies earplugs. 

Also, to the few thinking "he did this over $15? What a cheapskate!" I didn't do it for the money. I did it because they were taking advantage of people who didn't know any better. A menial ammount to you? Probably. But when i applied to this agency, I was broke as fuck and $15 was more than my hourly wage. Not cool.A company having a business model that relies on charging fees for breaking its own rules without justification for them.

Looking at you CreditOne. 

- Has a late payment fee but refuses to add any kind of auto-payment. In 2017. 
- Takes 5 days to clear a normal payment. Pay 4 days before your bill is due? That's a late payment fee. Want your payment to clear earlier to avoid that fee? Pay an express payment fee! Its the same fee amount? Lordy! What a coincidence!

Nominal weights and measures that don't match actual weights and measures. My company sells by the each but each item has a nominal weight. We intentionally produce our product approximately 10% light to save raw material costs.I've seen so many to name just one. Here's the worse I've seen.

So, [PCB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polychlorinated_biphenyl) are highly toxic, highly carcinogenic stuff used mainly as coolant in power transformers. Heavy industries often have their own transformers, usually on the roof of their building. When these transformers get old, they need to be replaced, and the PCB need to be destroyed properly. However, doing this properly is very costly.

So, a solution is to wait for a rainy day, then pour the PCB in the gutters on the roof of the heavy industry's building (where the power transformers typically are). This way they disperse on the ground and noone is the wiser. 

Well, since then, laws were changed to make sure that all power transformers are labelled and tracked by the government, to ensure their proper disposal. Still, sometimes a few older units get overlooked. And this is how I learned of this trick... the heavy industry's building is in the middle of a large city, with kids playing nearby and all. Fuck these fuckers.Fake promotions.
Theres a role you can apply for that doesnt have any extra pay or benefits, in which you do the same work as the role above that (which is higher paid) in the hopes that eventually you'll be the next in line to actually be given that next position. Except you wont.No auto-cancel on recurring payments. 

Companies could very easily add the feature but won't hoping you forget and pay them more. Using unpaid intern as worker. They have the exact same tasks has everyone else, they work the same hours, even more because they think that if they work more they will be noticed and hired (they won't), and it's rare that their supervisor take the time to teach them anything. They have to figure out things by themselves. Of course most struggle, and it's use as an excuse to not hire them.Online stores advertise their products at attractively lower prices but you will never really be able to get the product for that price because they will add extra charges somehow.  Careful (deceptive) wording.

"**Up to** 100mbps internet speeds!" means you get 5-6mbps, and "up to" 100 for a moment here and there. 

"**Made with** 100% Chicken" simply means that real chicken was utilized as an ingredient at some point. It's like saying a bottle of wine is "made with" 100% organic cork. 

"Sugar free!" means "Less sugar per serving than the minimum we have to report"

"The **top rated**____" usually followed by the specific study that ranked it best. Did you know you can pay a company to perform a study for you that's guaranteed to determine you're the best?Government contracting - Building a thing to "specs" but not entirely up to full functionality.

Give them 50 hours a week of work, no special overtime pay, tell them it'll be back to normal at then end of the month when the regular crunch is over.

Repeat until near a deadline.

Give them 80 hours a week, 7 days a week of crunch to meet the deadline.

Continue past deadline a little while then return to "regular" hours of 50 hours.

Repeat until your employees hate life. Refuse to give references when they quit "to protect yourself legally". Normalize across the industry so nobody can complain too much and sound credible.Convenience fees for paying online.  Instead of mailing in a check/money order.

Are you fucking kidding me?  You should be giving me a DISCOUNT for saving you labor costs of processing my payment

EDIT:  Everyone keeps mentioning they have to pay credit card fees, web site hosting, etc.  But that is part of your business.  Put it in with the other services you must pay for to operate your business.  Target has to pay a power bill and water bill for me to shop in their store.  If I spend $1 or $1,000 they don't add a fee for me using their store, wiping my butt with their toilet paper in their restrooms, or using my debit card or credit card.  If you want part of your business model to be accepting online payments then you set up your business so that you can still profit from this practice.  When Walmart installed those new "scan and find the price" things you see every 10 aisles or so they didn't tack on a new charge to my purchase for "We let you have cool price check scanners in the store now".  No, just a new technology they worked into their business model.  I don't pay extra for the guy pushing the carts into the building.  Even if I use a cart or don't use one.

EDIT 2:  Also, the original complaint that made me post this is that my state child support agency makes me go buy 2 money orders and mail them by hand every month because to pay online on their web site they want FIFTEEN $15 dollars!!!  Oh, and they already tack on $5/mo to my child support for 'administrative fees' that goes in their pocket not in the pocket of my gold digging pill popping tattoo artist cheating with crack whore of an egg donor.Comcast's pricing strategy where they raise the price an absurd amount from one month to the next and just hope customers aren't paying attention or too passive to complain.Literally anything a corporation does that they can be fined for is taken into account as a business expense. If it's cheaper to pay an illegal dumping fine than it is to change the way they process waste nothing will be done to stop the illegal dumping.People give no fucks about your luggage or parcel, they get dropped, thrown around everyday behind the close door, especially heavy items. Public school teacher here. My school has started to deduct vacation/sick hours if teachers forget to swipe in. We’re basically there all the time anyways and don’t get paid overtime so clocking in is pretty easy to forget. What ends up happening is teachers get their accumulated vacay/sick hours deducted WHILE actively teaching, all because of a forgotten swipe.
The admin and district people didn’t seem to see how  absolutely unethical this practice is and I never got back 4 days of vacay hours from missed swipes. Giving a set amount of PTO, then refusing to let employees actually use it, or shaming them for doing so.Refusing to pay overtime for overtime. I saw it happen all the time. I didn't complain. I got promoted a bunch.Getting a lot more common in my industry is hiring 'interns' all the time. After their few months of 'training' they get replaced by next batch. With the shortage of jobs and need for experience, many people fresh out of college will happily work for free to gain experience. There was a post about 'things your employer don't want the public to know', and I was amazed to see people say how common it was for a woman to be hired (in the tech industry mainly) basically to flirt with potential male business clients. 

The aim was to make them nervous/uncomfortable so the company would have the upper hand in negotiations.

Wouldn't exactly call that ethical.

Found what I was reffering to. It was on r/confession.

* Set performance standards that are borderline physically impossible to meet

* After the end of the temp period, be like "Sorry guys, can't hire you on because you didn't meet our performance standards"

* Hire a new batch of temps

A plastics company I temped for did this at their injection molding plant; the whole complex was run with basically a skeleton crew of company workers/admin with a constantly rotating batch of temps making up the bulk of the workforce.Ok so this is becoming really common in my neck of the woods. Basically a company need someone to fill a role. Instead of giving them a job and all the perks like paid holidays etc they instead hire you as a contractor. This means you still have to play by their rules as to when they want you in but you get non of the perks besides your wage. No sick days, no holidays nothing.

EDIT: I wrote this while at work as a quick comment and didn't expect it to gain any traction but since it did I need to make something clear.

I should have been clearer as there's a lot of confusion over this. I'm not referring to high paying jobs where a lot of the time being a contractor is the way to go. This system has been implemented over her for retail/service jobs. You end up making less **since you get paid the same as permanent workers** but you are entitled to no bonuses, paid holiday or sick days.

Those bosses are true pieces of shit and I happen to know a few of them. Student loans in the US-little to no approval process...they just give it.  High interest rates.  Refuse to settle, can't be discharged in bankruptcy.  They follow people well into their 40's, limiting their buying power for houses, cars, other stuff.  17-18 year olds have no idea what they are signing because we conveniently provide them no education on the process up until they have to decide whether to sign or not.I used to work for an unnamed university that made this big deal about how they were gonna pay $15 an hour by a certain year, well before the city min. wage was going to reach that (high cost of living). Patting themselves on the back. then there was the fine print. it was only for people HIRED to work 32 hours a week. so what they'd do was hire people to work one shift a semester, then scheduled them to work 15-38 hours a week (non students could work more than 20, I was a non student) but because the contract was only for three hours a semester.....

Also they didn't even pay the city's minimum wage for the first year i worked there. 2 bucks under. and when it finally did go up they didn't pay me the same rate as the students, who got the minimum wage raise. the three non student workers had to fight for two months to get the same pay...and the same thing happened the next year. I finally just quit. requiring experience for entry level jobs

EDIT: Good bye inbox. Thank you gold givers! I wish I could tell you all what your market value truly is but I can guarantee you its probably more than you're making. It's why when you find a new job your current company just so happens to magically find more money for you to match your new offer. As a bonus tip don't take it. Move on to better things! 

EDIT 2: Glassdoor.comHolding companies and operating companies.  So I'm a business called Consolidated Widgets inc. and I want to open a widget factory in the US.  Widget manufacturing is inherently dangerous but that's ok because the people need their widgets.  

So I build my factory, hire some workers, install some equipment, procure some raw materials, then I start producing widgets.  Invariably one of the workers, Leeroy is injured.  Leeroy goes to hospital and gets fixed but has ongoing disability for which he sues Consolidated Widgets inc.  but the case is thrown out because Leeroy didn't actually work for Consolidated Widgets inc. he worked for Flyover Widget Operating company which has substantially fewer assets than the multi billion dollar Consolidated Widgets Inc.  

What happened?  When Consolidated Widgets started this process they formed two subsidiary companies, Flyover Widget Operating company and Some Beach holding company (incorporated in Barbados).  Most of the material investment went to the holding company which owns the real estate and likely the equipment and possibly raw materials, basically everything but the people.  Then the operating company leases the facility and equipment from the holding company and now the parent company can insure that in the event of a lawsuit or government enforcement action their assets are mostly protected.  

This is not 100% secure though because if you piss people off enough the government can absolutely come in and say "this is bullshit, I don't care about your corporate structure you're essentially the same company so we'll pierce that corporate veil and take your assets anyway" but generally the government doesn't like to do this because the people in office probably have a vested interest in the continued ability to shield assets in this way.Textbooks. Fucking overpriced textbooks. Bonus points if the professor of the class is also the author.Bribing state representatives to support the idea of letting large corporations control what you see and do onlineTL;DR: Planned obsolescence and all the different types, with examples.

Planned obsolescence. Basically, products are designed by manufacturers to "wear out" after a certain period of time or amount of use. This is done to force consumers to re-purchase products or purchase new versions of products.

There are a few types of planned obsolescence. First is contrived durability, which means a product is designed to deteriorate quickly. A great example is how disposable razor blades wear out so quickly.

The second type is prevention of repairs, which means a product is designed in such a way that it is either made to be a single-use item (like disposable cameras), or in a way that uses proprietary hardware to prevent repairs and even damage the products if repairs are attempted. Apple is guilty of this with the majority of their product line-up, even seeking legislation to make it illegal to provide the difficult repairs.

The third is perceived obsolescence, which means a manufacturer frequently releases new "versions" of a product to make consumers feel as if the old product is far inferior. This is incredibly common, and in the grand scheme of things, fairly harmless. This type of planned obsolescence doesn't force a consumer to purchase a new product, but rather coerces them to, as do many other marketing campaigns. Common examples include new cars, phones, televisions, apparel, etc. for which new versions are released frequently.

Fourth is systemic obsolescence, which is when a manufacturer deliberately attempts to make a product obsolete by altering the system to make regular use difficult. Many people, including myself, accuse Apple of this when they release a new iPhone. Many people find that their old iPhone begins to run slowly after the latest iOS update following the release of the new iPhone model.

Last is programmed obsolescence, which is when a product contains a mechanical or electrical system that limits the amount of uses the product has. One notable example is printer cartiriges which use software to limit the amount of pages they will print, regardless of the actual ink level. Hewlett Packard was sued on allegations that their ink cartridges would "expire" on a certain date.

Altogether, these practices create an abundance of waste and unethically force consumers to buy more "stuff". This is a great way to make money hand-over-fist, and it is far more common than most people may think. People often complain that "things just don't last as long as they used to," which, excluding survivorship bias, is true because they are built not to.HR departments pretending that they have the employees' best interests in mind, when really they have the company's best interests in mind and will screw over employees if it's good for the company. Seen that in almost every place that I've worked.

Edit: Yes, I *know* HR works for the company, not the employee. It is just that I've worked in many places (and heard of many many more) where HR styles itself as the employees' friend, a place to turn to when things are not going well, when they are anything but.

Edit 2: I *have* worked at places where HR did actually bend over backwards to help employees. These were exceptions.Emissions testing garages that deliberately fail your car so that they can make money doing needless "repairs" (or recommend a buddy's business for the work).Making people only work 29.5 hours or 39.5 hours to avoid having to give them benefits.Paid parking at hospitals Not hiring people that are "over qualified". Sorry that I've got years of experience and bills to pay, my bad. Hire some dumb shit instead, go for it. Stress yourself out, lose all your hair, bitch about "I hate this job", whatever. Be proud of that shitty paying job, be the king of your own little hill, go for it. Meanwhile, some people just want a fucking job where they can work their way up. Pretty much everyone promotes from within, I think they just want that promotion for themselves and are afraid to bring people in that actually can do the job better.Checkout CharityIn construction management is full of thieves. 


1) the lowest bidder. Usually a friend of someone who tells them what the other bids are. They know they will win the contract and then the costs will rise through change orders and other unanticipated costs. Very common with public sector contracts. 


2) change orders. A lot of project managers (or in some cases, superintendents) will sign expensive change orders and split the money with the subcontractor (or in lieu of money have expensive remodels done on their own homes). 


3) over/under estimators. Estimators will purposely do both of the above in private sector jobs. For outright cash or other benefits. 


4) Business development. These folks will rep your company at trade shows, glad hand on your dime, go to expensive dinners win you contracts or, more likely will enjoy getting paid by you while they sell those contracts to your competitors. Or if they are very ambitious, leverage them into a higher paying job at a bigger company.


5) also in this industry (more on the developer side), you can count on sleezy environmental lawyers to sue your project on behalf of NIMBY neighbors looking for a settlement to go away or hold you up (at your expense) for years while they go up the chain of appeals saying your enviromental documents are insufficient, forged, inadequate, incomplete or whatever. Neighborhoods don't see that money. The attorney will usually walk for 100k though (depending on the size of your project). 


6) government entities will all (ALL) extort projects in any way they can. I recall one that was on the edge of a city limits, near a freeway, near a creek and had a green patch (seasonal wetland), near a walking trail. City wanted a new road, county wanted new bridges, dept of fish and game wanted a wider creek (for miles), parks and recs wanted a trail extension, state transportation dept wanted offramp/onramp improvements, army corp of engineers (for the wetland) wanted to remove the wetland and buy and donate riverfront property to them (personally) to replace it.

Edit: spicy, I got my gold virginity taken away, thanks bbThere is an investment "trick" which is probably illegal but goes as follows:

Someone comes to you looking to manage their investments. They give you $100,000 to invest in certain things, and you do... but at some point, since you're managing their money, you take out $5,000, invest that money yourself quickly, make a few hundred dollars in a short time, and put the $5,000 back into their accounts. You then keep the small profits.

This, done dozens of times with dozens of clients, can be super lucrative and you risk none of your own money. I think this is illegal has hell, but I don't know the technical term.

These employees work at your establishment so they can feed themselves, yet 90% of employers nowadays seem to have no regard for the fact that you need to sustain yourself with your wages.

My mother noticed after a month they hadn't paid, and went up to have a word.

The receptionist said "That's fine, i'll get it sorted and we'll post the cheque to you".

My mother said "I live across the road, i can see my house from here; i'll just take the cheque".

The receptionist said "I'll need to get the owner to write the check".

My mother said "I can wait".

The receptionist went back to work.

My mother waited.

The receptionist did nothing further to get the cheque and was talking to clients in the waiting area.

My mother confronted her and said it's cool, she can just go through to the back room and talk to the owner.

The receptionist called the owner in.

[Whole bunch of arguments and bloody *haggling for time* in front of the clients]

My father got paid.My two biggest customers do this on purpose to my business... Almost went bust a year ago when one went 60 days overdue on a 100k order with a super slim profit margin... Boy that was a tough cash flow moment .Just set up my own company 12 months ago. I have a nice contract with a flat pack furniture company who also do meatballs. They pay on time, but terms are "month end plus 45 days."it can be anywhere up to 75 days waiting for payment. If I've had sub contractors in, they want their money immediately, and if I've got 3 invoices waiting to be paid, cash flow is duckedThe big company holds the power. The small company just has to accept it. I got to see how this works one time when I worked at a small company.

"Hey, uh, it's been 90 days, can I get paid? You signed the invoice stating it would be paid in 30 days.."

"Our payment schedule will probably have you paid within the next 60 days, no more than 120 days from now."

"Yeah, but we need the money now. I'll have my lawyer be in touch."

"Well we can expedite payment if you choose. But you'll be taken off preferred vendor status while our in house legal reviews your account."

"Fine. Pay me."

And we got a check in 2 days. And never one more order from that company. I have no idea what happened beyond that because all of us hourly employees were laid off in short order due to lack of work..My first job as an engineer was working for a small firm (just a handful of us) and our time was completely monopolized by 1 big customer.  The customer wouldn't pay their bills to anyone, not for lack of ability, just for sport.  When suppliers would call and politely ask (and eventually not so politely ask) for late payments to be rectified, the plant manager would get on the phone and tell them to f*&k themselves, then find a new supplier.  Sometimes the owner / president would do the same, basically because he enjoyed ruining people.  They eventually ran out of providers for tools, materials, etc though.  When you're turning out shite aerospace components because your machinists are working with broken bits and tools they've salvaged from bins, then your customer stop paying you.  These guys went from being a billion dollar company to being a million dollar company to not being a company at all.  They took a lot of small companies down on the way though, including the one I worked for at the time.  If the scum that ran that place die penniless and alone in a cold alleyway, then it's still too good for them.Oh god, I used to work in retail and this was something my boss and managers always insisted that we do. I was a cashier and I was explicitly instructed to have a sticker or a keychain or some other low cost item on hand so I could 'add on' that item to the customer's items without the customer noticing. The intent was to artificially increase the average IPS (items per sale) which boosted our store's sales stats relative to the other branches in the area. A lot of customers didn't notice, and if they did, we were instructed to be all "Oops, sorry, I thought that item was yours, let me remove it from your bill." I hated it.

That was just the tip of the iceberg with them. They also made us sign up customers for a bullshit rewards program without their knowledge or consent by getting their phone numbers or email addresses. If anyone ordered online from our store, we automatically grabbed their information and added them to our rewards program database to (again) artificially increase our stats. It was slimy as hell and after a while I refused to do it. Best job I ever quit.

EDIT: This is getting some traction so I'll answer some commenters. Many of you want me to name this company outright, but I can do you one better. I have a hunch that my old company wasn't the only company that did this, so I urge you all to have the same caution no matter what store you go into. Black Friday and the holiday rush is the perfect time for this fraud to happen. Here is some advice that applies to any large retailer you visit over the holidays:

- Always check your receipt. Make sure there aren't any extra or missing items on it, no matter how many things you bought. Plus, sometimes honest mistakes do happen at the cash register. Better yet, take pictures of your receipt with your phone.

- Be cautious about giving employees your information. Sometimes it's used for marketing and advertising purposes, sometimes it's used for rewards programs, and sometimes it's used for a store credit card application. You can always ask why if an employee wants your phone number/email address, and you can always decline.Happened to me for the first time last Wednesday. Ordered chicken Alfredo pasta delivered. From the point I ordered, used my card to pay, and tipped the driver, until the point I pulled out my food, I didn't know they added on 3 garlic bread sticks for 3 dollars. Like, I have plenty of carbs here. I understand wanting garlic bread with pasta but maybe ask me before you add on 3 dollars?Automatically checking the box for "Add Bing toolbar to my browser" when downloading something/doing an update.these kinds of fines should scale relative to how much you made doing the illegal thing.Listen were gonna need you to go ahead and move your desk down to the basement...this works both ways. my company is extremely non-confrontational and will gently edge employees out instead of firing them. employees know they’re getting nudged out and are given months to find a new job while avoiding the “why were you fired?” question from potential employers. 

that being said, this is only done when somebody has done something intrinsically fireable in the first place. it’s shady af when done to people who could correct their mistake and still be a valuable employee. Or giving them impossible jobs to do and then using that poor management as grounds to fire them if they don't get so stressed they implode first. Already seen it happen a few times here. The boss is working on another one too.I used to work for a company that would literally bully people out of their positions. It was a small company so there was no HR or union or anything. The middle management team was three young women and two of them were best friends (we’ll call them A and B). They pushed the other one (we’ll call her C) out by declaring A in charge of delegating and then completing most of C’s big tasks before giving them to her. After a few months they had a whole stack of evidence that she wasn’t carrying her weight and she had no way to prove otherwise. Instead of firing her, they gave her the “opportunity” to be demoted to basically the bottom of the ladder and she was so upset that she quit. A and B weren’t exactly quiet about what they did and it’s pretty well known through the company that they pulled this shit. The salary is "dependent on experience". Then they inflate the job requirements so they justify paying you less, since you don't have all the experience they want.And then during the interview they ask you what your expected salary is. How am I supposed to know when I have no idea what the range is??! 

And so you play this twisted game where you try to throw out a number that’s higher than your currently salary but lower than a seemingly exorbitant number, all the while not knowing if you’re low-balling yourself either way. As someone who did some hiring in the past, I never understood why in the hell you wouldn't put this in your description.  It saves everyone including the business from wasting their time with someone who may not be interested after hearing the starting wage.  It basically funnels applicants out that are either under, or over qualified, and makes negotiating salary easier for both sides.But at the same time using a 40 hour work week to calculate things like PTO. Oh, you're tired from working 55-60 hours this week, Johnfest? Well I have great news! You'll work another 55 next week *plus* you're on-call 24/7.Work overtime: fine.

Need to leave work a couple hours early: that's coming out of your pay.And they wonder why the recent generations tend to company hop more...

No loyalty from the company? Don't expect any from the employees. That's pretty much my boat. Boss even tried to justify it by essentially saying it was hard to even get approval from the higher-ups to bring me up to the new minimum. 

It's hard to buy the whole "we appreciate you" rhetoric when paychecks speak louder than words...I’m pretty sure they got sued and had to actually make the foot long a foot long.Subway does a ton of shady stuff with their labor too. When I used to work there, they expected you to do a ton of off-the-clock training and called it 'Subway University' and expected their minimum wage employees to be "on call" for free.Sadly, people are stupid enough to fall for this.

I forget which store it was, but they would hike prices and have constant sales.  They then decided that wasn't worth the effort and money in advertising the "sales" and just marked everything down to the "sale" price and called it a day.

Their sales actually tanked until they went back to the old system.

People refused to buy the same merch at the same price unless they were explicitly told they were getting "a deal" on it.  Even when the "regular price" was absurdly overpriced to start with.I'm looking at you, Kohl's.And conflicts of interestUgh, I know what you mean about scheduling.

I worked at a grocery store that gave you your schedule on FRIDAY, and you'd have to wait to Friday to know if you worked Saturday or not! Absolutely absurd.My immune system had an implosion last year, had a bacterial mouth infection, about 50 ulcers in my mouth, throat, gums, etc. that made it impossible to eat and was also fighting an unknown autoimmune problem. 

Went to work with a 103 fever two days in a row because I was doing extra things and I wanted to impress the managers before the contract changes and get more hours. The autoimmune problem reared its head and caused anaphylaxis which is what made me throw in the towel and go to hospital. 

I was in there for 3 days on IV fluids and steroids+antibiotics, and didn't eat for nearly 2 weeks. When I got back to work, my contract stayed the same... I was gutted. My boss called me while I’m the waiting room, as I told him, to say he needed an answer right now as to how much time I need off work. Bear in mind I’m passing a kidney stone. Some heavily painful shit grunting in pain with tears in a room of 10 strangers and my boss is telling me I need to give him a time. I tried to say I don’t know could be one day could be 5 then have me more shit telling me I have a business to run, blah, blah,blah. I called in sick last Thursday, this being totally unrelated, completely informed about on Sunday. Saying my attendance was poor. Basically told someone else I’m close to being fired. I’m in Canada too so asking for diagnoses ain’t exactly quick. Seemed a little sadistic begging more some answer about something I don’t know when I’m under extreme stress from both pain and lack of sleep and I was already doing exactly what he wanted and he knew where I was getting him an answer. My family doctor told me “how many days do you want off? I’ll write anything on here” so I got 5 days off. And reassessment if not passed by then. But dear god lord do I want it out of me ASAP

Sorry for the rant but I was quite upset at my boss on the phone and he heard the tone and attacked me harder. Found out I need to get a new job today.

Edit: for real though if I get fired should I be contacting a lawyer? I haven’t even been with this company a whole year but it’s been a steady decline (according to other coworkers) since I’ve started due to major restructuring and problems with a couple employees. With now one out on sick leave (me) another (manager) on stress leave, and another just got fired for missing too much work. I’ve been here since April. I don’t plan on calling in sick but I’m not going to just never get sick. So if it comes to that would it be worth the hassle? I started in April and intended to stay in the industry, decent pay, I’m good at it. Forcing people to come in when sick can be detrimental to companies though- it's so ridiculous. Someone at my dad's workplace came in with swine flu and passed it onto about 5 other people. In total about 6 weeks' worth of work was lost.Step 1: call in sick

If the boss still forces you to come in, move to

Step 2: call the local health department and ask if they can do a surprise inspection of your workplace the next day

Step 3: show up tomorrow and have the inspector chew out your manager for letting you work and exposing every customer they served with whatever you have

Step 4: ???

Step 5: profitEnded up real sick from this.  Local diner, the manager was inside cooking food with a sweatshirt on (it was 80 outside).  As I was eating I asked him if he was cold.  He turned around looking like death.  Told me he had the flu and a 103 temp.  They forced him to come in since they were short staffed (they being district manager).

5 days later I have a 105 fever and the flu.  Ended up developing pneumonia from it and going to hospital.  Overall I ended up sick for a combined total of 6 weeks with a 103-15 temp for numerous days on end.  And that wasn't the worst part, pneumonia was.  I don't recommend it.Back when swine flu was going around full force in 2011, my roommate ended up getting it because she worked in a call center that doesn't give a shit about how sick you are.  So five infected coworkers infected basically the entire staff, and I ended up getting it from her.

This was when I was a front desk manager at a hotel.  I -also- worked at a company that didn't give a shit how sick I was and made me come in.  The owner of the hotel thought I was joking or overplaying my illness until I showed up and promptly had diarrhea in my pants.  She sent me home.

Then she called the next day and wanted to know if I was coming in.  Because, you know, swine flu clears up over night.Had a job where I suffered from laryngitis and severe fatigue (like body aches, shaking, fever) on and off for several MONTHS. And I kept coming in, I couldn't call out sick, even when my voice was completely gone (which happened like 5 or 6 times) my boss would get me to come in and do "no talking jobs." She had me watch her grandchildren for like three days when my voice was gone one time. On my one day off a week I spent it literally laying in bed, recovering just enough to be able to go back to work and run myself into the ground for the week. It took a long time for that wake-up call to hit, but once it did, I ran and never looked back.Never tell employers your previous salary. If they insist on asking, lie.

I do not believe this is even ethically wrong. If they intended to pay you competitively, they wouldn't need to ask. The only purpose in asking is to low-ball you.

Never tell a prospective employer your salary or even a salary range, for any reason. Never give them a number that you aren't comfortable making, because that number WILL be your new salary if it is below their expected range. That's why I tell potential employers that I'm already on the salary I would accept front them as a minimum. For example, if I really want to earn 40k, I tell people I'm already on 35k. I don't care if they find out (how could they anyway?). 

EDIT: Some very insightful comments below, that is all. I am in the UK and as far as I know, companies can't really check your previous salary (but I might be wrong).

Shocking to hear about the underhanded data sales!!That's why you don't tell them what you made. It's like if you are selling something on Craigslist and they asked you what you paid for an item. The answer is none of your business, what matters is what I'm selling it for now.Ugh. Stubhub is a den of thieves.Some also charge you to save an electronic copy to your phone...its beyond a joke. Also driving to the venue a week before the concert amd buying the ticket at the box office still gets hit with a convenience fee. You're saving them ink. WTF!!!!i really hate the temp agency route so many places are going. when i was looking for jobs machining everywhere around here was either a temp position or wanted some ungodly amount of experience. needless to say i took a job in the semiconductor field and will never be able to pay my student loans off. Was going to echo this and mention the "at-will" temp/contract hiring culture. It is predominant practice in this city that very educated, skilled technocrats get shit on by big firms who exploit them with endless temp extensions and shady labor contracts.

In this case, my beef has been not with my actual agency, but with an organization that has kept me as a "temp" for over a year now. I've been given the run around for months about turning into a "full hire", and then was told there wasn't room in the budget to bring me on as a part of the team.

The worst part was when my boss asked me: "well, if you already feel like you're treated as part of the team, why does it matter that you're a temp?" Precisely because I can be severed "at will" without any kind of protection!

As if shitty benefits, a laughable salary, and no formal ties to a company for whom I work my butt off wasn't obvious enough...

Ugh.

Edit: learning about at-will labor relations across the US from other commenters...Crazy. I feel like there are additional vulnerabilities, in some cases, with temp contracts - gap in benefits from start date to coverage, repeated changing of assignment with no coverage, overages in hours without contractual guidelines. No company protections, no organizational perks (commuter programs, etc.), or travel-reimbursements... Not to say temping is better or worse than any other shitty job, just equally as disenfranchising.Not to mention how they designed their name and logo to be so similar to the familiar and safe Capital One. I'm sure this has tricked people into acquiring credit cards they shouldn't have. I've accidentally thrown out my legit Capital One mail out of habit from throwing out the Credit One spam.

Edit: apparently Credit One came first so this probably wasn't by design like I assumed. I just finished paying off CreditOne. Never again> Looking at you CreditOne.

company is probably trash, I've never heard of them

no similar issues with citi/chase/capone/etc

edit: oh my god stop with the al capone jokes you're not original or cleverI got a card from them with a $500 limit when I was trying to rebuild my credit. 3 weeks later I got a bill for $100. Hadn't even used the card yet. Took me over an hour on the phone to cancel the card without having to pay the fee. What's funny is in the steel pipe industry they do the opposite. A lot of pipe mills will sell you heavier walled pipe to increase the cost of each joint.That sounds illegal as fuckHow is this not straight up fraud?You can contact OSHA or the EPA anonymously Whenever you accept a job with the "well for 6 months you'll be doing the lesser job but after that it's gonna shift into the better job with extra pay" spiel. Keep applying for jobs during that six months and line up other options. When you get the inevitable "well things aren't progressing as we hoped but if you stay in the lesser job another six months then there'll be a REAL possibility", just say "yes. Things aren't progressing as we hoped, here's my letter of resignation. Bye." As long as it has a title, I'm jumping on that, updating my resume with the new title, and then applying for companies that have a job on par with the new title.That sound like slavery with extra steps.I'm currently a student CNA, and during clinicals, rather than being taught what to do, we've basically been working full shifts for a severely understaffed nursing home, with little to no supervision. 

How am I supposed to get this 90 year old lady, complete with pressure ulcers and a broken arm bathed, dressed, and down to the dining hall in time for dinner, when I don't even know her name, am not allowed to make her do anything against her will and only have 40 classroom hours practicing on a dummy? I'm sure there's a way to pull it off, but nobody seems to have time to tell me. I swear the residents with dementia know more about what's going on than I do.

Illegal in the US. Unpaid intern work is not allowed to provide a net benefit to the company.This one is actually illegal. Interns should be a net cost to a company.

But, of course, those interns need those contacts and aren't going to burn them by speaking up... so... it goes on, and only the kids who can afford unpaid internships have a good shot at getting into some industries.Buying concert tickets and the like.

In the UK you might never get the top speed if you’re any reasonable distance from the telephone exchange. Technically impossible to achieve them because of losses on the line.  I do a lot of Federal Contracts, a lot of the waster here is because Procurement Officers don't know WTF they are talking about. I have tried endlessly to get specs right/more cost effective/more geared towards the application to no avail. In my experience the people working for the Feds don't give a shit if its right.. Someone sounds like a game developer...> Refuse to give references when they quit "to protect yourself legally". 

THIS right here is where I'm in trouble. I spent almost 3 years at a company working up the experience necessary for me to do travel work in the industry. They're 100% refusing to provide me references and they are doing everything they can to intimidate coworkers of mine from providing them for me, even if said coworkers are providing them through their own cell phone and email addresses. The problem is, the intimidation is working. The other problem, which I wish I could have seen coming, is my former employer only has 1 or 2 supervisor roles and they definitely outright refuse references. The issue with the travel work being that they require supervisor references even if I have several outstanding coworker ones already lined up. It's absolutely absurd. I've shed some hot tears over this a few times over the last 3 weeks.

EDIT: Since I see people asking what field others are in in this thread, I'm medical.Yes tell that to Ticketmaster. They have convenience fee, processing fee, service fee, all kinds of fees!My mortgage company just upped the "convenience" fees for paying online - $10 for an online payment and $15 for an over the phone payment - yet automatic payments are free. No thanks. I will continue to write a check once a month, put a stamp on it, and mail it *just* to be that pain in the ass customer and have a cancelled check copy for proof of payment. (I don't trust my mortgage company as far as I could throw a cheesecake underwater in a heavy undertow, and refi isn't on the radar right now for a lot of reasons.)

EDIT: I do use my bank's bill pay service to mail the check every month. :)Called Comcast Friday to try and lower my bill.  I tell them I don't want the phone, any of the premium channels other than HBO, give me regular internet instead of "Blast", and the I don't need the DVR.  They come back with packages that are $20 to $50 more than what I am currently paying.  Let me get this straight, I drop STARZ, SHOWTIME, CINEMAX, phone line, go to a slower internet package, and give up the DVR box and I pay more?  How does this make sense? And their likely oligopoly prevents you from leaving.  Never sign up for automatic payments.  I would rather pay the bill manually every month so I can see when the bill changes.Can confirm. My company didn't want to encrypt its computers and just paid a fine every year they didn't do it, until the fine got astronomically huge. Then they rushed through encryption and killed like 200 computers, costing themselves about $1000 per machine. 

I've learned businesses are not smart. They just set things up so that the circumstances are inconsequential when they make bad choices. Cost benefit analysis:

Break law or ignore regulation or outright steal from customers  + no risk of jail time = much more profitable than the cost of a fine and short-term negative PR

See: banking, finance, mining, etc.

Bonus structures that incentivize such behavior can't be ignored, either.I remember looking out the plane window at the luggage handlers (I do not recommend this) in Birmingham (US). They were dropping boxes, kicking things halfheartedly to push them in, acting like junior high kids given chores they don't want to do. Their orange vests hung shoddily from their shoulders as they shuffled around on the tarmac. 

Many hours later we arrived in Japan. The luggage handlers had white gloves (seriously), signaled each other in their transport carts, signaled and stopped even when no one seemed near, really took their jobs seriously. 

I don't suggest nothing ever gets lost in Japan and I know Japan isn't perfect. But the difference was striking. I’ve had friends and family’s valuables stole out of their luggage as well by baggage handlers. It’s fucking ridiculous You may want to look into this practice further in your state. This may be against the law. when I got legally married (we'd had out ceremony before the paperwork part) I was working at a factory.  The day before we went to the courthouse my immediate supervisor was fired.  I was NOT ALLOWED to take my PTO to go to the SS offices and have my name changed.  NOT ALLOWED as in, if I took the time off, even just leaving work two hours early to make it to the SS office, I would be fired.   NO ONE was allowed to take sick days, PTO or vacation, even if it was already scheduled for over a month.  

The waiting period between signing your marriage license and allowing for name change was 30 days.   While it hasnt been an issue with my last name not changing, I WANTED to at least hyphenate.  Ten years ago and I'm still pissed.  Yeah I could go change it now, at the cost of almost 200$. IIRC, unpaid interns cannot replace hired workers. That might be illegal.

Edit: I know it’s commonplace, nothing changes if no one speaks up. (But thank you for sharing your stories!)

E#2: [Any iteration of “its illegal but companies still do it”](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/WTDnnwE)Does the quality of work they produce not matter too much? Interns can be gung-ho and will work their butts off to establish themselves but many won't produce that great of work. That just sounds like slavery with extra stepsA friend of mine lives out in LA and recently tried to convince me to get a job out there. I work at a dispensary out in Tucson currently, so I hopped onto Craigslist to look at dispensary jobs out in LA, just to see what the options were.

Every single position I found specified looking for female workers."Female budtender wanted", "Female 420 model needed", it was really weird. I work in inventory at my current job and am more knowledgeable about the backend more logistical workings if the company, but none of the jobs seemed to be looking for anyone like that. They just wanted someone cute.I saw this once in the news business. They had a particular intern who was well-endowed and show-offy about it, and they sent her to do any interview in which they thought the person wasn't interested in being fully forthcoming with our editors/reporters. 

This girl managed to sit down to lunch with Billy Bulger. So I guess it works?If you're providing a free service, I can't fault you for selling my data. But if I'm paying for your god damn internet then FUCK YOU for selling my data... COMCAST... double-dipping assholes.> My internet is never as fast as advertised

That's why the advertised speed always says "Up to" so it's not technically false advertising. Still scummy as fuck, though. What would be the benefit of this? Wouldn’t they just have a bunch of constantly less than competent workers?Holy hell, I did this while going to college and it was the worst. I was getting paid 1/3 of what everyone else was getting for the same work and I had to show up to the temp agency everyday at 5 am to get 'assigned' to the same job site for work starting at 7 am (like, once I got the post a few times I was pretty sure I'd have that same work for at least a few weeks but they made me essentially apply for the job assignment everyday, with the prospect of being hired for real at some point by the factory).

The absolute worst part for me was that the 'temp to hire' fakery was well known among the other workers so no one bothered to get to know me. I ate a packed lunch there every day by myself for 2 and a half months. I had these stupid steel-toed rubber boots that I 'rented' from the temp agency (they took it out of my daily pay) because I couldn't drop the money on my own pair (and why would I, when the work was day-to-day), so all the workers just called me 'Ducky' the whole time I was there. By the end, I was mad at the company and temp agency for sure, but I was also pissed at the other workers who knew what was up, but they were getting theirs so they couldn't be arsed to extend some empathy.

Edit: My top comment is about how I was an exploited little temp Ducky in my early 20's. Solidarity reddit friends!

Thank you all for your kind and thoughtful comments! A few clarifications:

-My context is Canadian and this took place in the province of Ontario, which has shit legislation on who pays for PPE. The Occupational Health and Safety legislation that covers the Ontario jurisdiction doesn't specify who pays for PPE. If the employer has to provide the PPE, it generally must also pay for it. But if an employer is only required to ensure that workers use PPE, it doesn’t have to pay for that PPE (and if you're unionized, it's often spelled out in your CA). That's my understanding anyway, after a quick glance at the Ministry of Labour site. I commend those that are pointing out that forcing workers to pay for PPE is an actionable offense in other jurisdictions though! While acknowledging that some are better positioned to act than others, I'm a strong advocate of people knowing and exercising their labour rights!

-For those commenting that my agency sounded especially scummy/why didn't I complain and go elsewhere: This was with LabourReady, and they were indeed scummy (/u/isthatrhetorical mentions below that they go by PeopleReady now and are still scum). They were also the only agency in a small college town with a very high unemployment rate, which sort of exacerbated the whole expendable feeling.

-For those discussing the plight of the FT workers, for whom the presence of temps is a reminder that they're own job is not necessarily a guarantee: I absolutely agree! It was a hard lesson when I was young and as I mentioned, the worst part of a generally terrible experience. On the plus side, the lesson has been fruitful: I've evolved into a fairly active union steward and picket captain in recent years and have gleaned a lot of knowledge about how employers leverage precarity to divide workers! Being aware of the constraints that limit worker action and responsive capacity-building is super important!

-For those hoping I'm on to better things: Thanks! I teach law and policy at a university these days (where I frequently use labour law to instruct and empower my undergrads). Sessional/Adjunct course instructor work is precarious and temp-like in a lot of ways, unfortunately, but I at least get to do it in whatever goddamn boots I want.> This means you still have to play by their rules as to when they want you in

Not legally. The IRS very clearly lays out that one of the 1099 requirements is that you make your own schedule. Others include using your own equipment and direction. The IRS is not a fan of companies cheating that system. The problem is their backlog is pretty large so it may take awhile to get to them, but feel free to report companies that do that shit.FWIW, in the US this can get a company in trouble both with the IRS and the state unemployment agency.  Basically, if you have to behave like an employee and are treated like an employee in most respects, then you are a statutory employee.  I've been through PA state audits in which I had to prove that my subs were truly subs and that I wasn't bypassing labor and IRS regulations.  A company can still get away with it sometimes but there are some rules.Add to that companies who lobby the government in order to create barriers to entry.\*cough* google \*cough* 

Edit: I can't wait for EA hate to stabilize

Edit p2: I didn't realize there were this many google fanboys on reddit. It's like I've insulted Elon Musk or something.many years ago, i worked an hourly job at a not-quite fast food restaurant. a few years after i quit, i heard from a former coworker that he had discovered that the manager was not reporting all of our time. he found out because he began to copy his time-card and compared it to his actual paycheck. he found that she was not reporting/paying him about 5 hours a week. he sued and found out that he wasn't the only one she was doing this to. of course, i found out after the business went under...Damn I knew my old employer was doing that to me but some friends worked as well and as managers made a decent amount and they are the ones who hired me. Boss man wanted us to be the best restaurant in the state, which we got to meaning bonuses for him, and we did this by having employees come in 1 to 1.5 hours prior to when needed to prep food. I was part of the evening shift but we close at 9pm so boss man would make us check out at 9pm but we would have to stay till 11pm, midnight once.

I didn't want to say anything because one of my friends was couch surfing at the time so he was living paycheck to paycheck, the only job within a walking distance, and he needed health insurance too. Another was also couch surfing off his girlfriend and at least could drive to work but got caught up in dept. It really did not help us that one of the cooks was a minor coming in fucked up on LSD we just had to send him home.

I was going through rehab at the time so I had to show the court I had a job too, so it was a mess. I really did think about speaking out but I couldn't risk me losing a job and fucking over some good people who also literally couldn't. 

Eventually, I showed the court enough so I left, friend 2 leaves shortly after, boss man gets a promotion to become regional manager in the northeast region, and friend 1 quit the following year. Fuck that shit show.This used to happen all the time at my old company. You had to jump through the hoops to post a job, get resumes, and interview a shortlist of a minimum 3 people IIRC before you could give the job to the person you already hand-picked months ago. Most HR departments have requirements that jobs are posted internally first and then posted externally for some number of days before the intended person can be offered the job. 

My former company was sued because they *didn't* post the job.  They just fired someone in the position and then promoted someone else, didn't ask them and they didn't even want the promotion, they just showed up to work and they said "this is your new job now."  Didn't train, just threw him into the position.  It caused a number of problems.  It was all because the director of that department felt that the hiring process was a waste of time. [deleted]This also gives colleges no incentive to charge reasonable tuition costs. The zero education part is the real kicker. At my school they told you to file FAFSA but that was about it.

Plus another thing that is a bigger problem that you'd think is the fact that schools paint college as the only option. We had tons of resources for picking a school and narrowing down a major (even had a designated college advisor) but absolutely nothing else regarding trades or other career opportunities. I mean not everyone is meant to or wants to go to college, but the school system really makes it seem like that's not the case.

They don't really come out and say "no college=failure", but with how much they talk about college and how little (see: not at all) they discuss other options they seem to portray it that way.Many of the ads put - 3+ years experience required, so they can filter out the people applying before it happens.
One of my first jobs was as a Bartender which the ad said needed 3+ years experience in fast paced rtc etc. applied, got the interview and asked hem about my lack of experience, and they said quite openly that they would interview whoever, just that line filtered 90% of the idiots that apply without any intention. 

EDIT: ok, my inbox doesn't like me. The OP said it was an entry level job. Not for CEO or something that requires a college or university degree. 
Employers are often inundated with applications from people, so if they can minimise the applications by putting on a "minimum experience requirement" then they will. But employers often look for people with drive and what's the worst they can say to you? No?> "Its a GREAT oportunity to learn"
> Learn what? The meaning of slavery?

https://twitter.com/HumansOfLate/status/911294335521607681> They dont bother to "Teach" you anything cause "You will pick up as you go"

>" Hey... you studying the law right? I have a great opportunity for you to work as my secretary."

In the USA, this is illegal. The unpaid internship needs to be for the benefit of the intern, not the company, and they can't replace a paid position. So, an intern getting coffee or whatever is a secretary which would be illegal. My first job was one step lower than this shit. 

I was working at a printing press shop because I had some experience from working at the one at my highschool. 

Get fired 8 weeks in, given some bullshit excuse about me not being good enough (even though I found and corrected more errors than the pressman I was working under). 

Then the lady at the front desk that I had befriended bumped into my outside of work a few days later and explained that they fire that position every 9 weeks so they get a full time worker, but never have to pay benefits *or* unemployment. 

The business is now closed, though probably due to the shrinking business of printing things, instead of just their shitty business practices. Just got fired, essentially because Ihad been working at a company for so long that my pay was $3 higher than the starting wage. Payroll got to be an issue and they seemingly let me go so they could pay someone less money to do the same quantity of work that I do. Youll notice that's how it always works. Hell ive been seeing more and more managers try to get their employees to do several jobs with more hours but the same pay.This. Ever wonder why a store like Wal-Mart will have 600 workers capped at 31 hours, instead of 200 full timers? Because benefits kick in at 32 hours a week.

Edit: Hmmmmmmm 3 "I work for Wal-Mart and it's awesome" responses in under 5 minutes, after a few hours of none. 

Looks like Wal-Mart PR just found this thread.See also, quantity vs quality.  People spend as little as possible on something and wonder why it breaks quickly or easily.  When spending even a small amount of money on the same item (or similar) will yield much more life out of the item, saving money in the long run.  Unfortunately, it will still take several decades for the "Walmart" mindset to be replaced.

See Also:  
Inkjet vs Laser Printers  why is that not good? You get 2 weeks of, unemployment if you need it and since they're a shitty employer, they wouldnt be giving you good recommendations in the 1st place.Can you get me to the top of the post, father?It definitely happens but in the business world, accusations -> lawsuits -> settlements have been happening for a couple decades now. Most companies are pretty reactive to this sort of thing when they find out.

A few jobs ago, I worked for a gov't contractor. One day, completely out of the blue, my boss, a director, got fired without warning. Like, literally, the Sr. VPs from out of state showed up without warning and fired the guy in 20 minutes. We were all irate, but ~9 months later, we found out he was sleeping with one of the women who worked for him. 

Turns out, this company had settled a harassment lawsuit a few years prior, so as soon as they got wind of this affair, they canned him without remorse. Of course, they didn't tell any of us this, we had to figure it out on our own based on rumors through the grapevine.

I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but that in the business world, things are at least a step and a half in the right direction. It's so difficult in entertainment b/c, like, who are you going to run to if Louis CK asks to jerk off in front of you? There's no Global Comedy HR Department or no company you can really sue to try to curb this kind of behavior.I can attest that the same thing happens in academia. Source: union delegate for university workers.It's because power corrupts. Hell, even though we are currently purging a number of predators from the movie industry right now I have a feeling things will revert back in a couple of years once they're out of the public eyeAbout 15 years ago, I worked for a company that absolutely forbade people talking about how much they were paid; it was considered a fireable offense, and you had to sign paperwork when you were hired stating you agreed that you could be fired for disclosing your salary.

About six months after I started working there, the HR manager printed out an Excel spreadsheet listing everyone's salary, and forgot it was on a community printer. Someone found it, made about 20 copies, and just left copies lying around the place. 

Jesus, the drama...

EDIT: Holy crap this blew up!

This was California around, what, 1999? So, god, 18 years ago... 

A lot of what other people described, with a twist. The company was privately owned, and the owner/CEO paid people for the same position that shared his political/religious views more than others, and that got ugly fast. Certain people were paid bonuses (it was indicated on the sheet) and others were not, even though everyone else knew who the real producers were, and the people that not only got a higher salary for the same position, but shared his views, also got larger year-end bonuses even though we were all supposedly on a profit-sharing plan.

Some people stormed into his office and demanded raises, some demanded back pay, others up and quit, there was just turmoil for like a month. The HR manager did not get fired; they were one of the owner's favorites. Lots of fingers being pointed, more than one "work friendship" ended because of it. I was in a two-man department, and I was the manager, so I knew what I made and what the guy who worked for me made, so there was no drama for us. Yeah, its not like i come to work because i like it and the salary is just a nice little bonus."Salary discussions are grounds for dismissal."

Luckily we have the internet now and it's a lot easier to find places to help gauge your worth.Lots of companies actually have specific policies against discussing salary. The thing is, those policies are illegal to enforce.  However, most states have "at-will" employment, so you can fired without having to justify anything. If you can prove (*very* hard to do) that you were fired for discussing your salary, the Department of Labor will bring the hammer down on that company.Its only taboo to talk about your salary until your next prospective employer asks, then you *must* tell them so they can low-ball you :) oh and you must sign a release so they can verify that you're telling the truth so that they can pay you the least amount possible :)Had a conversation with my colleagues about their COL raises. Found out we all got different amounts even though we were all working on the same project with same level of responsibilities. Definitely frowned upon by HR but will allow for better negotiation in the future. I had a few professors in college that wrote the textbook but gave us the PDF versions for free.And the Human Body changes for the 10th year in a row?One of my former professors (I have since graduated) wrote, printed and sold hos own text books. Those books cost $20 an piece and you only needed one book for two years. The books is apparently industry known and utilized for how simple and direct it is.Correct. I went back to college to study a night course in Business a few years back. There was one textbook that apparently we absolutely HAD to have, it was marked as essential material. The latest edition was something like £200. I went on eBay and bought a used previous edition for something like £4 including shipping.

Compared it side by side to the latest edition which was in the college library and could literally see no difference at all, all the pages I checked were identical.

My lecturer shat a kidney when they saw it. "You can't possibly use that, it's an older version and all the material will be out of date!" Me: "That's OK, I'll take that chance".

Despite being marked as essential reading material I literally never looked at the damn thing once, I got all my sources and references from websites. Had I shelled out the full price of £200 for what was essentially a very expensive paperweight I'd have been pissed.

So, yeah. The whole textbook industry is a scam.My Business Ethics professor authored the textbook and priced them at like $200, which just oozes with irony. It's basically the classroom equivalent of awarding a contract to a company you have a financial interest in instead of awarding it to the lowest bidder, a business practice that is considered particularly *unethical*.Gotta lol at this one. 

The company I previously worked for was constantly trying to get me to take on much higher level roles without any increase in compensation. 

There was a clear routine. My manager would bring me into his office, tell me there was a great opportunity for me to take on a new role and that instead of offering training or compensation, I would take on the role and be paid in experience. 

I would say no. HR would call me and shit talk my manager: 
"It isn't your fault you declined this offer, your manager is an ass dont you think? Trust me on this one, you should take this offer. Take it and I can guarantee I will move you to a new location away from your dumbass manager. By the way, everything you tell me is confidential buddy. I'm here for you only".

One time I asked him how senior management would feel about me taking a position with no intent of actually doing it at my current location. 

The HR guy responded:
"They're right beside me man, you're on speaker!"

To be fair this is illegal not just unethical. That's why in California for smog testing, a smog testing place can't do repairs and vice-versa. I mean yeah, they could still recommend their buddies place though.What is this?Most places won't bother with that.  Work at Will means they can fire you for no reason at all.  Proving that you were fired for something like age discrimination is incredibly difficult.The intent was there.This has killed gaming for me. I refuse to buy games that do this, so as a huge Star Wars fans I've accepted that I won't be playing any of the video games for the foreseeable future.> but I don't know the technical term

It's called "bank"Breach of fiduciary duty.  Fraud.  Theft.  Embezzlement.

Take your pick.The last company I worked for at the end of 2015 when I negotiated my raise I asked for 40k. They told me that they couldn't give me that but would give me 36k plus 4k in quarterly bonuses. Time for the first bonus comes around and my boss says "we aren't doing well enough to give quarterly bonuses. I'm just going to give you guys one big Christmas bonus." Christmas rolls around and the boss says "Nope still not doing well enough for bonuses maybe next year guys." Then before the year ends ties bonuses to performance but only in acquiring accounts which only the boss was allowed to do and he was phenomenally bad at. Or it was on purpose cause he was happy with how much he made. I brought up that he promised me bonuses as part of my salary and he couldn't recall it. Moral of the story get your salary negotiated and in writing. Don't let the boss claim good faith on his part. Oh yeah and that year of no bonuses? At the end of that year after my boss told the whole offices no bonuses. He traded in his 35k 3 year old SUV and bought a 70k Lexus outright, in cash. Yeah. No bonuses. Right!> in front of the clients

Good lol make the clients aware that the owner will try to dodge paying themPretty sure you can report that kind of activity. Maybe they should start with *atleast as high as the money saved/gained*, no?I’m going to burn this building to the groundThis happened to me. They moved me to literally right outside the manager's office, positioned my desk so I was in eye contact, and I proceeded to stare directly at him all day, every day. I slowly added various googly eyes on staplers, pen holders, my drink bottle, the back of my monitors etc, all pointed at him.

I got moved back to my original seat within a week. I WIN THAT ROUND, PATRICK.The old "buzzword soup" job description. Every acronym you can think of, even though they'll never be used.This one hit a little too close to home. Toss in the bullshit salary that they don't tell you is actually $5k less than what it really is because that $5k is actually a performance bonus they'll only pay if you meet their goals and if "the business does well" according to a metric they won't tell you that they'll inevitably miss no matter what. 


Oh and offering you a lower salary because you live in a lower taxed state and not telling you you're going to be taxed as a resident of New York because their offices are in NYC and they internally categorize you as a remote employee. 


And when you pay for their health insurance you find that since you're a remote employee of a state across the country you can only get care at facilities that aren't in your area so you get to pay extra for care or don't get coverage because you went out of the network.


"Six months of experience here is like two years anywhere else."I have absolutely 0 job loyalty and it has served me fairly well.  I'm making good money and a coworker who worked here since being hired out of college (same amount of experience more or less) is getting paid 60% of what I am.There was a manager on here the other day whining that their employees kept leaving for better paying jobs, and that the current generation had no job loyalty.

Seeing (and taking part in) them getting torn apart was satisfying.YES. Ugh. 

Appreciation doesn’t pay the bills. Ugh same! I always get told I’m “part of the family” at my job but when I asked for a raise as I was doing more work and another year had passed since my last raise, they got offended. Yet they continually tell me the whole family fiasco which is a bs! [deleted]My franchise owner paid me for the time I took Subway University classes. I believe it was JC PennyIt was JCPenney. It's not just that people wouldn't buy things that weren't on sale, it's also that lowering the base price of your products makes them seem worse in quality. Ten bucks for a ten dollar jacket, or ten bucks for a *fifty* dollar jacket?I worked at kohl’s on the night crew and we unboxed items with a certain price tag, printed out a sticker with a higher price than the original price, stuck that sticker over the original price tag, then printed a sale sign to put over the rack. The sale price was almost always higher than the original price in the box. If you have new clothes or anything from Kohl’s I encourage you to peel that sticker off the tag and see how bad they actually got you with that “30% off sale.” They prey on people looking to save money. It’s shiesty as fuck. And hiring of spouses I worked at a gas station that did this. We had a computer system for people to request off that would literally remove them from the schedule for that time period (so there was no way for the manager to schedule them if they had asked off).

The manager wouldn’t give us a password for the computer system, saying it malfunctions all the time so he prefers to do everything on paper. So every Friday when the schedule came out, we had to double check that he hadn’t scheduled us during times we couldn’t work. 

He was constantly scheduling me to work during times I had class, despite telling me in my interview that he could work around my schedule. When I complained he tried to say that I should be a “responsible adult” and work, since school is only meant to prepare a person to work anyway. I not so politely informed him that I had no intention of being a gas station attendant at 60 like he was, and I would not, under any circumstances, skip class to work.and THAT is why no job or function is worth your health. Work till you drop, 2 months later nobody will remember you. Health > work.Want to know something insane? I've had bosses that insist I come in while sick when I worked with people who were immunocompromised. It wasn't just bad business because I could spread it to my coworkers, it could *literally* kill our clients. They had the attitude that I should always come in and if I was really sick they'd send me home again. Because that's a great idea when you're working with people who can catch their death if you do so much as look at them funny. I'm a health inspector and I'd do more than chew them out. For something like that if at minimum give them fines. If it wasn't the first offense then I'd do what I could to find enough violations to close them for a day or so.You had a 115 degree fever? You may be dead.Had pneumonia last year, don't recommend it.  I definitely see how it kills people easily.  Felt like a car on my chest.Some folks will disagree, but I think you're right.

Your employment isn't a favor that they're doing you, it's a negotiation; services for money.  Imagine going to a car dealership and instead of a sign posted, they started off by asking how much money you make in a year so that they can adjust their price based on that. It shouldn't matter, that has nothing to do with how valuable _they_ think that car is.  The company you're applying to should already know the market value of a position; your specific salary can only really be used against you.

So if they're trying to gain information to be used in an unethical way (which is the only reason to ask previous salary), you have no obligation to be honest with them in return.  They even say it at the end of most applications; if you're found to be lying on your application, you will be denied the position or fired from the job.  That's your punishment; worst case, you don't get the job.Are you joking? https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/7c8xmx/equifax_sells_your_salary_history_to_debt/They just tried charging me $18 in fees per $60 ticket I was purchasing. Nope!I worked for an electrical contractor that more than half the office staff was through a temp agency. 250 electricians, 20 normal office staff, 22 office temps. And most of those temps had been there for years. Shouldn't there be a limit to what defines a temp? And how could it be cheaper to pay an agency $24 an hour to turn around and pay the poor girl $12? Couldn't we offer the lady $16, make her happy, and cut the agency out of the loop after the initial obligation? Keeping temps on for a lot longer than 'temporary' is sadly becoming a business practice all over. Entry level position. Requires five years industry experience.What the f+ck?? Why hasn't Capital One done anything? That's like **a textbook example** for why trademarks exist.Same here. I've never dealt with such an absolutely shit company in my lifeThe company is certified trash. Their logo is even designed to mimic CapitalOne’s to trick people into getting their cards Wait, how does that increase the cost of the joint?I work in the industry and can say that it may be true we invoice by the ton but suggesting that a company does this on purpose is not entirely true. We have to bid on jobs and we submit offers before production. We have to work with the same contractors on a lot of jobs and if we started hosing them by being underhanded like that then we would not get future business. On top of that there are very strict standards involved as well and the nominal thickness is on very slim margins usually around .010 of an inch. The only time we use thicker materials is when we have partial coils from older jobs that meet the standards, and then we still have to come in under budget which we would reduce the price.They're probably within the legally permitted margin of errorbecause regulations allow for a stated product to be +/- a certain percentage to allow for imperfections in the manufacturing process.

This is meant to prevent people from claiming fraud on every single package/item sold because of how difficult it is to be 100% precise with weight/quantities.

EDIT: my guess is the allowable tolerance hasn't kept up with improvements in precision in the the manufacturing process and is based on decades old manufacturing equipment.  Which allows a very modern manufacturer to be intentionally underweight but still safely within the guidlines.You can. 

However they seem to have to catch them in the act of doing it. (According to the officer I spoke with.)Just quit a job because I was told I'd get a raise from 8.50 after they trained me. I made it very clear that i couldn't make my bills long term on the training rate.

Trained me for three days, two months later and still no raise. Bye bye!My brother in-law did this. When he got promoted without being paid extra he worked for a few months while looking for alternative jobs and sure enough a company offered him more than what his current company was offering. He told his boss about the offer, the boss told him that he would pay him what that company was offering. He told the company, the company offered even more. So he switched. 


Edit: I'll add that at his old job he was a supervisor that had something to do with building industrial machines. He would come home covered in fiberglass almost every day & would get calls all the time to come in at 3am to fix things people broke. When he left he was paid quite a bit to still fix things there/train others. Now he has an office job. No slaves have to be fed and bought. Interns are cheaper. bought olive oil that had “gluten free” on it. Who THE FUCK PUTS WHEAT IN OLIVE OIL? [Relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/641/)This is pretty much true everywhere, data transmission isn't lossless and the further from the exchange the more is lost.I've been on the other side of some of those discussions. The vendor is sometimes very willing to bend over backwards and help and accommodate, if only they can get some specific questions.

Vendor: "So what are the specs of XYZ process that you interact with?"

Me: "I can't tell you, it's not in scope."

V: "But if we know that we can better design this solution to mesh with your overall process flow." [and possibly upsell, let's be honest]

M: "Right, but it's not in the contract so we can't talk about it. Contracting team won't let us. Modding the contract would delay moving into production with this solution at least six months. I agree that a more holistic solution would be better but our budget only allows for what is in the contract, and we can't convince the higher ups to spend more, so they would prefer spending more in the future when the rest of it breaks. Next question."

V: "Ok.... About paragraph 3 subsection c, it says *fiddle the dingleberries* -- are you sure you want them *fiddled* and not *fondled*?"

M: "Look, we thought *fondled* was better but the contracting team said we have to use *fiddle* because of some government rule. I'm not the expert on contracting, I'm the technical guy. We can live with *fiddle* but we aren't happy about it. But that's what they required, and while it will cause some disruptions and some of our people will have to work overtime it won't cause a catstrophic failure so we just have to go with it. Next question."

Etc etc etc.That's exactly what I was thinking. I wonder if this guy worked at Rockstar San Diego."Well you see, ever since I was in high school, I've always wanted to be a game programmer! I'm so passionate about video games and I want to give back to the industry!" 

*proceed to crush him with 50-hour work weeks spent creating microtransaction systems*Ordered NFL tickets on stubhub yesterday. $80 base for the tickets plus $30 in feesIt's ridiculous.

I'm not paying more money so they can get their rent faster and labor free.>as far as I could throw a cheesecake underwater in a heavy undertow

You're a poetJust tell them you’re going to straight up cancel if they don’t give you lower cost Internet. In certain markets it may be a full on monopoly. I once threatened to leave Comcast while on the phone with them and they called my bluff by saying "Who else are you going to get internet from? We're the only ISP even physically connected to your apartment." and they were right, and I had no more bargaining power.Yup. They've tried it to my parents over and over and they call up and say, "Uhhh this is higher than last month. Why is it?" "Oh we had to increase th-" "Ok we don't want it anymore. Take us off after this month." "Ok we've returned you to your normal rate."

Lol this seriously happens at least once a year.Businesses are made up of people, and people are often terrible about thinking and planning in the long term. Many businesses die because they look to maximize short term profits rather than ensuring long term stability.Someone made their bonus for multiple years keeping operational costs down and then moved on before consequences kicked in. It's not stupidity, just a different agenda.> Japan isn't perfect

That's true. They did have a train that left 20 seconds early last week. It made world news.Also, people were shocked to see that their courier or letter carrier throw their parcels across the yard...  Trust me, the parcels had had it worse at the depot. Not even supervisor would care about it, as long as nobody gets hurt. 

Edit: a word I follow a japanese friend on twitter, she ordered like 50 manga off of amazon.co.jp and  they were very neatly shrink wrapped and wrapped again in another layer of plastic wrapping. Meanwhile US amazon is just a bunch of factory workers who are told to be as efficient and quick as possible so they just throw your stuff in a box and add a few air bags and call it done.Not in my country. Quality of the work isnt really an issue. They know they can get let go at any time if their work is particularly bad, so they do try and impress as much as they can.Those batteries aren't going to charge themselves.It's really prevalent in SoCal from what I've seen. Literally about half of the budtenders that I've dealt with in LA county look like they've never tried harder in their lives to resemble Kylie Jenner and none of them ever know a single thing about the products they're selling.Don't forget they made Netflix pay to not throttle their content. Tripple dipping right thereReminds me of those "SAVE UP TO 50%, OR MORE!"

haha, so I can save anywhere from 0% to 100%? useful.Similarly, "99% of the time it's more than 0 Mbps" doesn't make for great advertising.You hire temps to do low skill repetitive labor work, such as manual packing. Temp workers are cheaper, even with the extra fees going to the temp org, you can have them do risky work and cycle them whereas a long term employee might get a repetitive injury after years bending to pack boxes, and you don’t have (edit: spelling) to deal with them. Sexual harassment case? Call the agency and have them replaced. factory work is generally low skill. Imagining you eating lunch alone in a pair of rented steel-toed boots makes me sad :(

Hope you found better employment afterwards.>  I was getting paid 1/3 of what everyone else was getting for the same work and I had to show up to the temp agency everyday at 5 am to get 'assigned' to the same job site for work starting at 7 am (like, once I got the post a few times I was pretty sure I'd have that same work for at least a few weeks but they made me essentially apply for the job assignment everyday, with the prospect of being hired for real at some point by the factory).

I've had to do that. It fucking sucked. I felt like I was one of those guys hanging out outside the coal mine during the great depression. It was nuts. Why did the temp agency make you keep coming in at 5am to be "reassigned"? Sounds like they were doing a shit job, and everybody dropped the ball in that situation.Former accountant of four decades - can confirm. Yet this is extremely common in the US. Most large companies, especially in manufacturing, hire through a temp service - often a temp service that just exists to staff one factory. You may work there permanantly, but you are technically a temp. Its a way of shielding companies from union organizers and generally stripping workers of any sort of labor rights.Current situation for me. It sucks. And they get away with it by only holding onto contractors for 2 years. But most contractors either get a lot of experience for another job somewhere else or just get hired by the company before the timer dings.It's not "barriers to entry", it's "important regulations to help the public". You know, because they're socially responsible corporations who just happen to be able to afford the 83,000 lawyers it takes to comply with these public-minded rules. This happens on a big scale and small scale. My dad had a friend that started a drywall company in a smallish town in Colorado. He'd buyout any other company that started up (usually for hundreds of thousands of dollars) just so he wouldn't have to bother with competing with themMy manager at subway did this. For example, if my shift ended at 1pm and we were super busy until 130pm, I wasnt allowed to leave until the rush died down, but she would cut off that extra 30 minutes. I always knew it happened but once I had to fax something to the office and accidentally printed off the wrong page, and it was the sheet that showed the manual changes to the time clock, knowing it happens is one thing but actually seeing the exact numbers pissed me off so much. The reason she did it was because the owner gave a bonus at the end of the year to whichever of his managers of all his stores had the best labour %. Fuck that job.

The worst was closing. We were always understaffed for closes, scheduled until 130am, but sometimes would have to stay as late as 3 or 4am to get everything done. If you leave right at 130 you get written up, but if you stay you dont get paid. Fucking bullshit.I really hate unnecessary bureaucracy.Also colleges putting ridiculous luxuries in the dorms with no opt out/opt in process. CU Boulder has a sushi bar in their student dining center, and then adds the cost to room and board. So...I should apply to jobs for which I don’t have the "required" experience for.

You give me hope. I️ needed this today. My last job did something similar. About 2 weeks before I hit the one year mark I got called into the manager's office. They told me I made a huge mistake on an important car (I detailed cars) that had been done half an hour before I even got there. I asked them how it's my fault if I hadn't even left my house when it was turned in, and they said it was my responsibility to make sure my coworkers were doing their jobs even though I'm not a supervisor and, again, I wasn't even there. They didn't care, they told me I no longer had a job and to not worry about coming in the next day.

I still see the head mechanic from time to time at my new job, and he said that the same thing happened to the guy I started with a week after I left, and the other guy that got hired 2 months after us and got the same thing about 6 weeks later. Turns out we get benefits at the one year mark and we're just worthless car washers so we just get recycled. My replacement was there the day after I left, and a year later he apparently got the same speech. > believing

Dude, this is why I quit my industry. I've survived a couple waves of layoffs. They cut all the older guys because they were making more money and kept the newbies like me. Yet, I was expected to take on their hats. No extra pay for doing so. I thought to myself, fuck this man, this is how the company is going to treat me in 10 - 20 years. Just toss me on the street, not because I was terrible at my job or shitty personality, but because I was a few more bucks more than the starters. 

After the wave of layoffs, The new hire I was training was lowballed for her starting pay. She was fresh out of private college but she was being paid almost the same as a new Costco cashier. Our jobs were extremely stressful and technical. I quit and encouraged her to quit too. She did and it was the best career move she ever made. Places like Walmart also like to keep people's schedules in flux because if it was steady you might do something good for yourself like look for a better job. What's worse is that some employers just lie about it. I have a current coworker and at her previous job she worked 39.75 hours a week and they told her she wasn't full time... I mean yeah it's sort of on her for believing that, but that's pretty fucking shady. Her mind was BLOWN when I said you're considered full time and entitled to benefits if you work at least 32 hours a week for more than 12 consecutive weeks in a fiscal year. Also that if your boss causes you to meal violate YOU can't be punished for that. 

Maybe it was just the store she worked at (because she worked at Target), but holy shit if the labor board found out about even half the stuff she's told me and investigated, heads would roll. Yup, remember when 40 hours a week = mandatory insurance? Hourly workers were always scheduled 37'ish hours a week. Washington thought dropping the benefits requirement to 32 hours a week would instantly give millions insurance. Haha, nope. Now everyone is just routinely scheduled 7 hours less a week to be under 32, which takes MORE money out of the lower classes pockets. Backfired tremendously. You can't defeat corporate greed.And that's why policy should be judged on its effects, not intentions. Yup where I worked if you crossed the line you were immediately terminated. If it caused a lawsuit they were fucked as the industry would know and they would be blacklisted.I don't even think we're really purging anything now. Just a handful of famous names with stories that the media can make money off of. Nothing is changing. It's just pretend change. Pretty much this exact thing is happening at my current place of work, and the secretary who printed it is getting fired for “causing a stressful work environment”

The kicker? We work in the public sector and by law all of our salaries are public information.

Edit: For those arguing with me, in my state the dollar amount is listed. You can literally google “name salary state” and it will pull it up. To the dollar. Please stop arguing about that part with me, I know it is unusual, but it is the case here.Talk about a friggin' goldmine for all the gossipsIf in America, this is illegal. You are allowed to discuss your salary with other employees, period. It’s considered an essential step for potential collective bargaining.This is interesting for me, I work for the county so everyone's salaries are public information. Anyone can google a person's name and there's a site that has every employee's salary.But that's exactly how you're supposed to act. Like open conversations about money are taboo because you're supposed to act like you love the job, and salary is just a side note. I wish it was the other way around and job interviews would start with salary offers before getting to the "okay so are you interested in doing such and such work" this is illegal in the USThe only good thing about at will States is that if they do fire you for some BS, it's incredibly easy to get approved for unemployment compensation.I haaaaaate when employers insist on knowing your salary info.  There's literally no good reason for it except to screw you.

It's like a car dealership or realtor asking you "What's your current payment?"Starting Jan. 1, 2018 this is not true in CA. Prospective employers will no longer be able to ask what you make at your current position, and will be required to provide a salary range for the position they're offering.

Edit: Some folks are pretty pumped about this, and they should be. However, let's remember that this is a new law, and how it's implemented is yet to be seen (in CA, at least - I can't speak to other states).I've only had to do it once, but my answer to that was "I'm very happy to give you that information on my first day!" Didn't get that job though.same. I'm not saying it doesnt happen, but I've never had a professor who wrote the book and didnt either give it away from free or just tell everyone to borrow a copy of an older version

edit: the professor who gave copies of his book away had a CFA I'm sure he didnt need the money and it was for the one upper level econ class I needed for my Social Studies Education degreeSuddenly math is completely different.

1+1=chickenMine did for the first 20 years or so.Writing and printing and selling their own textbook and requiring you to buy it? That's super shady and that professor should be ashamed of...waitaminute. $20? 

That professor is a fucking saint and I want to send them a thank you note for doing something that straightforward and decent even though I never had their class."Thanks for shopping at PokéMart, your total is $42.12. Would you like to round up to $43 or donate a full dollar to help out your local PokéShelter for homeless 'mon?"

The mart promises that you're money will get where it needs to go. They get to hold on to lots of cash tax free for a while and then write a check for a lump sum when the promo ends. No to mention the adverts they can run for free publicity by wording it like "we HELPED raise $10,000,000 for Homeless Pokémon". People feel all warm and fuzzy about the business even though it was us who gave the money. 

Technically you can keep your receipts and deduct the donation, but who is going to keep and deduct 88 cents. Let alone that you have to give up your Standard deduction and itemize your taxes to do that (in the US at least)The pride and acomplishment was not.Or any EA game Reminds me of that Key and Peele skit. "Motherfucker that's called a job!"I pick embezzlement for $5,000!This is why it doesn't work that way in the real world.

>The big company holds the power. The small company just has to accept it. I got to see how this works one time when I worked at a small company.
>"Hey, uh, it's been 90 days, can I get paid? You signed the invoice stating it would be paid in 30 days.."
>"Our payment schedule will probably have you paid within the next 60 days, no more than 120 days from now."
>"Yeah, but we need the money now. I'll have my lawyer be in touch."
>"Well we can expedite payment if you choose. But you'll be taken off preferred vendor status while our in house legal reviews your account."
>"Fine. Pay me."
>And we got a check in 2 days. And never one more order from that company. I have no idea what happened beyond that because all of us hourly employees were laid off in short order due to lack of work..

Credit to u/SillyFlyGuyYa, that's pretty illegal in most places.But that would be a deterrent! We can’t have that!I believe you have my stapler.Basically translates to "yes, it's cold calling and you'll be a miserable alcoholic in a month."Ummm I hope you’re not actually filling a New York State income tax return for anything other than claiming the entirety of the NY withholding as a refund, it’s up to state statutes where you’re tax residency is, not company classificationsWithout a doubt. You will get 2-3 percent a year from your current employer, but I just gave myself a 50% raise by jumping ship after I was sure I had raised my skill level enough to be promoted. I tried hard to let my current firm promote me, but at the end of the day, they had no interest in paying me more so I got my promotion elsewhere.So they were sued, just not successfully lolThe intent is to provide shoppers with a sense of pride and accomplishment for finding good discounts.
Mos def JC Penny. The head of retail at Apple was hired as their CEO and this was his brilliant idea. Clearly he didn't understand budget consumer psychology.This is also true.

Friend of mine makes horror movie replicas that he sells on ebay.  He priced his work fairly based on his time and material cost.  Couldn't sell them.  He INCREASED THE PRICE and couldn't make them fast enough.

People took one look at him selling an item for $35 that everyone else was selling for $100 and decided his must be worse, even when they were obviously of better quality.  He increased his price to $10-$15 less than the others, and they sell like hotcakes.

People are freaking stupid.We have a scheduling system that you can access in your phone, trade shifts and check rotas, it's awesome. You can even set your preferences for work, when you can, when you can't, you can even request specific time off.

Not that our manager pays any attention to when I ask for one particular day off, despite asking for maybe ten particular days off a year. I got a story for you then.

I am a nurse and maybe a year ago we had a scabies outbreak at work. It started with someone doing the night shifts. At first we thought it was just some kind of reaction to the disinfectant. Sometimes people get dry skin, pustules, things like that. But it didn't take long until more people started to show symptoms and a few weeks later some of my colleagues had it too. Every time we told our direct superior that it looks like scabies she told us we are just being paranoid, that it's just dry skin, a lot of people get dry skin, we need to use more moisturizing cream, it's basically our own fault for not taking care of our skin.
Everybody stayed quiet after that but it only got worse. Some time later i got it too. Man i tell you that stuff is nasty. It started with my hands, then i got it on my neck, on my thighs, genital area, the stuff was everywhere and it just wouldn't go away, it only got worse. 


So i went to the doctor, told her what was happening, she looked at me and was kind of hesitant to diagnose scabies. I think because she knew i was working in a nursing home, and as you surely know when there is a scabies outbreak in a nursing home it's a public health issue, it needs to be reported to the public health department and that's bad news for the nursing home.
As i was saying, she didn't diagnose scabies, but she still gave me an ointment called "InfectoScab", and who would've thought, after i took it the symptoms subsided. It took quiet some time for the stuff to go away, i'd say at least a month. At least! 
But it wouldn't disappear completely. There were still some spots left and i had the feeling they were growing again and i was right.
The stuff started to spread out again. 


At this time nobody at work had gone to the doctor so i guessed i got infected at work again because the whole place was still contaminated. So i went to my boss again and told her i wouldn't come in tomorrow unless we are being taken seriously. After that i had to go the big boss and tell her the exact same thing and our nursing management finally scheduled an appointment with the dermatologist. A week later he came to us at work. Looked at us. Didn't diagnose scabies. 
Schooled us about skin care as if we're too stupid to know the difference between dry skin and scabies.
But just like the doctor i had gone to, he too prescribed us InfectoScab "just to calm us down" as he put it. We had to time it so that every employee and patient took it at the same time so we could make sure that none of the critters would survive, so we all came to work on saturday, put the lotion on ~40 patient from head to toe and after that on ourselves. And it was a miracle, even though it wasn't really scabies the drug that's specifically designed to get rid of scabies worked.
It took some time again for the symptoms to disappear completely but we were scabies free, finally.

But i was mad as hell that it took managment so fucking long to do something about it.
I should've gone to the public health department myself. its alright, Osmosis jones saved him.Or brain damaged.You can lie when you fill out your credit card forms.  The companies do not check with the IRS or your employer.  They normally get this information from you indirectly.

* Discover wants to know your current income?
* American Express wants you to update your annual figures for their files?
* Bank of America / Chase who ever asks your income?

Add 10%-25%, after all you might be getting a 25% bonus at end of the year.  If they really care, they'll ask for proof of income.  The credit agencies are semi-self referential in that Equifax gets your old wage data from Discover.  Amex checks your updated wage data against Equifax.  Amex then sells you updated data to Experian, who later sells it to Visa to compare with your next "promotion".
 
If you use this to wrack up a shit ton of credit with the expectation that you're never going to repay you may be hitting wire fraud or some other crime.  If you use this to bump your credit, improve your ratios, don't abuse it, etc. you're likely fine.With temps your company does not have to count them as employees. So "smaller" company as far as employee count goes. So they pay less taxes, don't HAVE to provide insurance to what few employees you do have while not paying workmans comp and all the other government fees. I got spam snailmail from them, and the logo really threw me. Why hasn't Capital One sued them to death over trademark violation? It literally _is_ "confusingly similar!"

The only explanation I can think of, is that they're actually a subsidiary of Capital One.Sold by the pound?

EDIT: Well, this really took off. To be clear, I have never bought pipe. I was just asking, myself. Hence the question mark at the end of the sentence. But they gotta be very precise in their "impreciseness" or they could go way below marginal weight.Seems like there'd still be a case of fraud  If it's +/- 10%, but on the minus side 100% of the time.They can just go test the ground around where it was dumped for PCBs. They're persistent as fuck and are probably evidence enough. I would hope anyway.This is 100% not true.  I work as a government contractor for the EPA, you don't have to catch someone in the act of doing anything - if you did nothing would ever get cleaned up! Nearly all environmental issues are discovered well after-the-fact (and to be fair, most are due to leaks the owner didn't know about).  All businesses are required by law to permit their PCBs and other hazardous materials (such as carcinogenic solvents), as well as keep their haz waste manifests and service records on file.  They must be able to produce both if directed by their LOP or the EPA.  Failure to do so makes them a responsible party by default and they become liable for subsequent clean up and remediation, usually under both federal and state laws.  

The exact law that applies varies from state to state.  I work primarily with UST cases, and I can tell you that in California the code that makes cleanup enforceable for underground storage violations is [Section 25299 of the Health and Safety Code](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&sectionNum=25299).  Under those codes, a fine of $5,000/day per tank can be assessed for each day of delinquency, and a fine of $10,000 per day, per tank, can be assessed failure to comply with an issued notice of violation or cleanup directive.  And yes, those fines stack.[deleted] I outright had to supply the wrong thing about a month ago because of this. A guy running a contact couldn't understand the different between dimensional lumber, and roundwood.. The local agency is not allowed to talk to me about what they ACTUALLY want. 

 So I win the contract, order in the material and have 3 seriously bummed BLM employees who cant do a thing about it. They needed dimensional lumber so they could adjust some grades in a  campground, but the PO kept telling me they wanted roundwood. I am not sure how the project worked out, but I printed all of my emails back and gave them to my local guys, wherein I argued with the officer for weeks about what the actual material ordered was supposed to be. 
Concert ticket $69.90? What a steal!! 

*checkout*

It's $100 please and thanks FYI Stubhub has an option when browsing to “include fees in price shown.” or something like that. I auto-click it every time I browse Stubhub so I feel slightly less fucked over when I checkout. I think the only thing it doesn’t include is tax, so it’s pretty close to final price. Used to do the exact same thing.  Walk your ass down to the bank to deposit that check, stupid office lady.This backfired on my brother.  They were like "ok you're canceled" and he was too proud to say "oh um just kidding."  I call it the ComCrap Dance. They manage to raise my rate between 50¢ and $1 per month for bullshit fees (oh no, never raising the cost of service of course) and then when my service rate is about to go up at the 12th month I call and negotiate some more bullshit. It's so annoying and I can't wait until my city puts in their own fiber network.Happened to me when I was too broke to pay my Time Warner Cablr bill.  I asked for a week extension and they agreed, three days later no internet.  I call them and explain to them the conversation I had with a previous representative... "oh that's a different department I wouldn't have any way to verify that" (I thought all phone calls were recorded?)

So can I just pay my past due and current balance Tuesday and have my services restored?  "Sorry there's a reconnect fee of $150 and the account you had was a promotional blah blah blah

They were wanting me to pay twice as much a month.  

Honestly... unless you play games... do we really need internet at this point with our high speed data and hotspots?  

I told the woman on the phone as such and, OMG look you actually qualify for a much lower monthly with higher bandwidth and bc there was a miscommunication we'll wave the reconnect fee.

They're e fucking bullshit artists and I'm sure *at least* 50-75% of people fall for itNot necessarily terrible, they just think in their own interest rather than the company's. Short term profits are good since by the time the consequences hit the ones responsible will be in a position where they no longer have to deal with them. Someone once explained the Japanese train system to me this way: 

"If it's 9:02 and you're standing on the platform with a ticket for the 9:07 and you see a train coming into the station, DO NOT GET ON THAT TRAIN.  That is not your train.  It's the 9:03 train.  *Your* train will arrive in four minutes." 20 whole seconds? What is this, the Middle Ages?!Meanwhile here in Romania trains never arrive haha.I know you jest, but Japan's subway system is so timely that 20 seconds _could_ actually cause a monumental fuckup somewhere else later on.I worked in a FedEx ground warehouse. It was a shit show. Boxes falling off conveyor belts and getting crushed by other boxes. It's about how much you can fit in a semi and boxes aren't organized by weight, they're just stacked in there.
Edit: Also weed gets shipped through fedex regularly. They're too lax about a lot of things but you can't leave the warehouse to go smoke, and there's only 2-4 people in a trailer so I know the smell was coming from the boxes.> and add a few air bags

German Amazon can't even be bothered to do that.Ah, sorry, assumed USQuad dipping because Netflix will install data caches inside an ISP network to reduce congestion for free.Speaking of unethical shit, this was actual extortion.

Literal blatant extortion.

And Comcast wasn't punished *at all*. In fact they only benefited from it.

Comcast seriously just needs to die in a fire.

*Edited to swap embezzlement for extortion. If you're going to talk about a company's actual crime you should use the right term!I would look into that just incase I can start saving 101+%The commercial for Geico has always struck me about how much effort it puts into being non-specific.

"A 15 minute phone call could save you 15% or more on car insurance."

So it could save you 15%. Or maybe more. But also, maybe not. 

"Call us and talk for 15 minutes and maybe something will result from it." That's the non-weasel way of saying that.I see nowI got a company black listed from offering internships at our school because of this practice. I show up as an intern and they task me with designing some test bench setups, these are all quick turnover. I get to the test floor and realize they have people working in INCREDIBLY dangerous setups: exposed wire, extremely high power output, and a steady recycled list of untrained temps.

I raised issues multiple times with my boss and he told me to ignore those stations - that it wasn’t my job. Eventually I grabbed another engineer, brought him to the floor, and showed him what they were doing, he agreed to help me modify the benches to add some modicum of safety to it - my boss comes to the floor and starts yelling at me, I told him to follow me to his office where I unloaded on him, told him to fuck off. I immediately went back and talked to the dean and explained everything (with pictures). They got banned from all career fairs and internships, and are no longer allowed on campus. I was a temp. Once. For one day. It was enough to teach me to never be a temp.

I went to the agency asking for office work, as I wanted experience. Sure, they said. We can do that. We'll pick you up tomorrow at 6. 

Too inexperienced to question that, I waited to be picked up at 6am. Lo and behold, I was taken to a salad packing factory, where I spent the next either hours packing bags of salad, being a human conveyor belt when the mechanical one broke down, a human salad tosser when the mechanical one broke down, and just generally doing things machines should be able to do. I had no means of getting home until they picked me up, so I worked the day as I may as well get paid.

Worst part was making smalltalk with a polish chap over lunch. Turns out he was being paid more than me (which was fine) by simply turning up at the plant in the morning and asking for work.

So the agency was probably paid a bonus over and above the going rate for getting me there, took an additional cut on top of that, and even then couldn't find me a job in the very vague field I'd asked for.

Fuck you, Manpower. Fuck YOU.Same in the UK too.Here in Florida, you can do this [straight through the government](https://www.dms.myflorida.com/workforce_operations/human_resource_management/for_other_personal_services_employment_ops). I was OPS for about a year before getting a full time job where I was working. Others aren't so lucky. Some of my co-workers have been here for a couple of years now, do the exact same thing I do, but are OPS so they get paid less and don't get benefits (except I think the state now has to provide healthcare thanks to the ACA).Also dont forget the "i have enough money to sell at a loss until competitors get out of bussiness" scheme.When i worked in retail my boss asked me to clock out and help him finish closing up, so i clocked out and left. He tried to chew me out the next day so i resigned there and then. He was furious, really thought i'd stand for that. Its sad that it must be so common he thought that shit would fly. Lmaoooo today is my last day at Subway, and I feel you. This is why I do perfect clock-ins and -outs and print the receipt. I hate my manager who does the payroll. She’s 22, and she didn’t get trained, so she underpaid me for weeks. I hate it. When I worked in a McDonalds in the UK I could see my clock in and out times online and if it was manually changed it would say exactly how it was changed and who changed it. Didn't think much of it at the time but reading this has made me realise how good that actually wasMy subway experience wasn't a changing the clock but my manager was crazy paranoid and counted the bread obsessively and believed if the bread count was off or the register was light that meant the employees were stealing so would extract DOUBLE the amount missing spread across everyone's paychecks if no one came forward.  I wish I had known more about how illegal this really was at 15I also worked at a Subway that did this and I was always kept past the end of my shift to help with a rush, do prep, empty garbages, etc. It was typical for this to take up to 30 minutes to an hour every shift. 

I complained to my manager about it and her response was "some overstay past the end of my shift should be expected". When I replied that if it's expected I should just be scheduled longer was met with a shrug and that look that says "if you don't like it, leave." Yea but we're gonna need to put a hold on raises this year, HR needs to hire a few more recruitersYeah for sure, but if the number is wayyy beyond where you're at then you probably aren't there yet (like being a new grad and trying to get a marketing job and aiming for director positions that require 7-10 years) vs a more entry lvl one that is asking for 1-2 years.That's scumnificent.Warn others. If you haven't already go to Glass door or Google reviews. Those comments always help so much.I love how much shit the millennial generation gets for not being loyal to employers who act like this. It’s not a sign of loyalty to suffer your fucking abuse.This is happening at a slow pace in my place of work. Field technicians with 20-30 years on the job will be getting surplused soon and us newer techs with 2-10 years at most will replace them for around ~$10 less per hour. They just slowly add more tasks on us every year or so that used to be performed by the older techs, until the point the senior techs won't be needed anymore. Work in retail is hell on earth. They usually hire college students and pay them shit 'cause they're gonna leave anyway.[deleted]> Maybe it was just the store she worked at (because she worked at Target)

Target is just Walmart for people willing to pay a little more to not be seen at Walmart.Beyond the fact that everyone should get health care, this is my number two reason for universal health care. It would remove the link between work and healthcare, allowing so many part-time workers to pick up hours and money at their jobs as employers wouldn't have a healthcare reason to deny them full-time employment.

I think it would really help the middle-class get a better work situation with universal healthcare. If only anyone could have predicted thatI guess depends on your context but my understanding is most places its illegal by now to bar such discussionsWell some of them only had silver mines and a few bronze mines.

Edit: Yes, I get it, bronze is an alloy. Concessions were made in the name of a [joke](http://images.fanpop.com/images/image_uploads/Homestar-Runner-homestar-runner-139906_1024_768.jpg)For anyone who's curious:

"Employees who are not represented by a union also have rights under the NLRA.  Specifically, the National Labor Relations Board protects the rights of employees to engage in 'concerted activity,'  which is when two or more employees take action for their mutual aid or protection regarding terms and conditions of employment.  A single employee may also engage in protected concerted activity if he or she is acting on the authority of other employees, bringing group complaints to the employer’s attention, trying to induce group action, or seeking to prepare for group action.

"A few examples of protected concerted activities are:

"Two or more employees addressing their employer about improving their pay.

"Two or more employees discussing work-related issues beyond pay, such as safety concerns, with each other.

"An employee speaking to an employer on behalf of one or more co-workers about improving workplace conditions."

([NLRB](https://www.nlrb.gov/rights-we-protect/employee-rights))

A lot of people aren't aware of the scope of protection federal law provides to employees. The anti-union brainwashing effort by the right has been highly effective at convincing workers not to act in their best interest.

The downfall of private-sector union membership is truly tragic.Yea, in several Nordic countries (if not in all of them) your earned income records are public information. So if you know someones name you can just ask the tax office what was their earned income last year. It's not really uncommon to talk about your salaries.

Tabloid magazines commonly have special editions the day the information of last years income is released. "*Oh look this celebrity is actually broke! Oh this dude makes millions in a year!*"Name checks out. I dont think you're paid enough man...When I interviewed with apple that's how the interview started. May have just been that manager's style, but the interview started "pay is $x (I forget exact amout), we don't wear dress clothes" and then he dove into a really interesting technical interview.It's also illegal in Germany but there is a clause in every contract that forbids it in my firm 

After 2 minutes of research I found out that I can't be dismissed for it or fired, and it's amazing to see how nearly nobody knows that. 

Everybody just says "You can't do it it's in your contract not to talk about it", too bad that people eat it up without looking into itPretty much. My boyfriend started as a supervisor for a cabinet factory for four years and then they decided to open a second location. They gave him the title of engineer finally and a salary bump for him and a few others to set it up. He was responsible for buying machinery and setting it up, making sure everything was connected, etc. He was working 12-14 hour days to meet the deadline because he was promised a $10k bonus. Right before the deadline his job was essentially done, and they started getting workers in there, the first day they started 3rd shift someone fucked up and didn't schedule a supervisor to supervise the 3rd shift workers. My boyfriend and another guy decided to stay all night because they couldn't just leave the workers alone. He was probably on his 26th hour of work when they fired him (just him.) 

Unemployment only wanted to know if he had any previous write ups or verbal warnings, which he hadn't. He was approved for the maximum amount of unemployment for the maximum amount of time. That doesn't offset the loss of benefits.  I'm the one who supplies Healthcare and other insurance to my family.  Makes the loss of my job that much more painful.

Guess that's one reason large corporations don't want universal healthcare.

Edit* Now my highest upvoted comment   Thanks to everyone.  Hope your holidays are good, and you're all safe and healthy.I always just lie and say it’s 10k higher than what i’m making, you don’t have to be honest with them.I wish more places did this because why should I fill out your application only to find out you pay $20k less than I make now? Save everyone some time and just print your salary range! I had a professor who wrote a book, made it mandatory for class (he checked and gave you your first assignment grade based off that), and we never used it. That book was $100... On a possibly related note he randomly bought a really nice house and moved to Florida after that semester. He was a jackass.Two plus Two is chicken minus one thats egg quick maths. Yeah true, the bigger company can just take their business elsewhere. But they've literally breached a contract and caused a business to go under. It would be nice if there was some kind of recourse that they could take for compensation.All places. Especially grabbing the billing stuff. The payment processor should be a direct line between the card holder and the card network (visa, mc, amex, discover) then the store website gets an approval code and sends the product. I wouldn't doubt if they were stealing card info too. I could put... I could put... strychnine in the guacamole.Honestly, I know this is a joke but its more or less true. How often do you tell someone you like  a shirt/jacket/shoes and they immediately tell you what kind of deal they got on it? "Hey I like your jacket!" "Thanks it was originally $6500 but i found it at TJ Maxx for just $3000! Isn't that great? Aren't I a great thrifty shopper?" People really do get jazzed and prideful for finding "deals" its pretty interesting from a psychology standpointI love this meme.It actually literally is though What he had was common sense, which is lacking in basic human psychology. 

This also happens in other areas. Agilent makes high end oscilloscopes. They made a new model that was awesome and no one bought it. They tripled the price and they flew off the shelves because they seemed "premium" to the buyers.

Seriously.Also, sometimes they get to brag to clients/investors/customers/gullible potential employees that they've never ever had to lay off any employees (because they just use a bunch of independent contractors and it doesn't count when you just don't re-hire contractors, even if they make up the majority of the labor force in multiple departments that you just sent home).They aren't.

We shouldn't be clamoring to *avoid* GMOs, we should be clamoring for *better* GMOs. All civilization is ultimately founded on farming technology, and there should be no shame in continuing to push that bullet.

However, there should absolutely be shame in dumping toxins into the groundwater, or wielding your company's seed technology like a crown and scepter. Nice! On the completely opposite end of the spectrum, cans of peanuts contain a warning on the label that states that the can contains...wait for it...peanuts.The agency or department will, naturally, have a mandate that emphasises accountability and efficiency. (It was in their annual public report ffs!!)

The next step will be a thorough review of the contracting process, and as a result of that, area managers and directors will no longer have signing authority. Everything will need to be signed by the Deputy Minister or Minister. All contracts will have to pass through a 5-member contracting committee with three stages, or “gates,” to ensure compliance. This will add approximately 4 months to any approval. And you will still not be allowed to clarify what the local office actually wants. The next year’s annual public report will cite the procurement team for innovative best practices and recognise them with an award of excellence for stewardship. That is just so messed up. Yeah generally speaking we aren't allowed to speak directly with vendors before the vendor is selected. However, vendors can submit questions to the contracting team which is then required to forward the questions to us, for answer in writing back to the contracting team who then provides the verbatim response to the vendor. The process itself isn't "wrong" it exists specifically to avoid vendors having an "inside track" and helps keep the process more fair by forcing everyone to go through the same process. But if the contract team is not on the ball (which happens a lot) or the program office has someone less than competent assigned to run the project and respond to questions (which also happens a lot) then things like this happen.

I watched one project go through a lot of issues because the guy put in charge of writing the RFP that became the contract statement of work was NOT the expert on either the technology or the problem domain or the customer organization -- *I was* -- but he was the boss' pet so he got the lead role. This was despite the fact that I have a decade of experience *with that software in that domain in that org* and have handled contracts for exactly this same type of product before. And I had been pushing for *years* for exactly the type of transformation that we were about to undergo ("his idea" of course) with this product and knew the requirements blindfolded.

But because of the dynamic that was set up I had to take a back seat, so all I could do was wash my hands and watch it unfold. I would up being called by the customer organization for secret meetings behind his back to help them craft responses back to him to "fix" his RFP drafts so the actual requirements would go out properly. But even then things got fucked up and we ended up buying software that now a year later still hasn't been used. Immediately after buying it he decided to take it through software testing and approval personally, meaning he was installing and testing the software, except he didn't know exactly what to do so he would run to me for advice and eventually tasking me on the project. I kept telling him to calm down and tried to guide him as best I could, but he would flip/flop and try to do everything at once, or if he ran into a problem he would try to change everything and start over instead of starting small and making incremental baby steps to move forward in testing. Besides I kept telling him his job should be to *coordinate having the vendor perform the test* but he insisted on being "hands-on" which meant his actual job as project manager wasn't being done. And because he was "hands-on" he would overrule my advice and direct me to do what he chose despite my advice against it, but ok whatever dude I get the same paycheck at the end of the day. I did what I could to try to keep it alive because it would ultimately benefit tens of thousands of people, but it was like trying to steer the Titanic with an oar.

What a waste of time, money, and effort.That's a cheap fee, too!I once saw my provider was offering low rate to new customers which also included better service than I had.  Cheaper AND better for new customers while the loyal customers got screwed (this was not comcast btw).  I called and bitched and asked for the new rate and they refused.  I canceled because like your brother I was too damn stubborn to back down.  
  
Three days later they called back and gave me the lower rate and higher speeds.He probably caught someone on their last day lol. Me and everyone I know with Comcast have been doing this for years and it never fails. The key is to basically threaten to cancel but in as much of a pleasant/sympathetic way as possible. They’re basically told to give discounted rates to appease customers but they’re human too, they’ll be a lot more willing to cut your rate if you’re nice. Our investment system thrives on year-over-year performance, too, rather than anything longterm.If your train is more than like 5 minutes late they give you a slip to give to your employer or school to explain your tardiness was their fault and that you should not be punished.

The manager asked me to clock out and then take out all of the store's trash. A small thing, but I refused because there was no way I'm running trash up and down two stair cases for 30 minutes and not getting paid the trash wage, just on a matter of principle. My hours went from 38 a week to 8. 

Fortunately I was just a college student who was trying to save up for beer money when I was at school, but damn that could have really fucked people who actually needed the wage.https://www.dol.gov/whd/contact_us.htm <-Wage and Hour.
Also if there are any worker centers near you, contact them. Their whole purpose is just to get people paid. You deserve your backpay, friend.Definitely. I graduate in two weeks and still trying to find something. Dad advised me to apply anything I feel half-qualified for, regardless of recommended experience. 
Also that the requirements are often just the qualifications of whomever held the job previously. 
Now, more than five years probably requires some serious expertise, so it’s a little beyond me. But 1-3? I could probably swing that. Or, failing that, print 1000 flyers with this information and periodically post them all around the business. This is how things like this were dealt with before the internet, and it can still work. The Vanity Fair writer Dominick Dunne did this to a business that hired the man who murdered his daughter, and he was so successful that the murderer eventually moved to a different part of the country and changed his name.The shit part is, they know it's the reason why it's hard to keep millennials. I work in construction. There is an annual meeting/trade show the upper management attends every year. This past year they had a speaker that all he talked about was how to work with a millennial workforce. He even straight up said, "You can't treat them the way you treat the past generations, they won't put up with the abuse.".

It's why being a "millennial" is being stereotyped as being lazy, unreliable, and stubborn. Businesses want other millennials and younger generations to look at it in a negative light so they'll be more like the older generations and just suck it up and get fucked in the ass. "Sure I work 60 hours a week with no benefits for shit pay, but at least I'm not a lazy millennial".

It’s insanity here. I’m actually considering quitting because I think it’s such bullshit.Doesn’t say he *only* has 8 nickels though. Technically Warren Buffet has 8 nickels too$X salary?

Amazing description.I got two day shipping and it didn't come on the day at the time they had mentioned. I did a text chat saying something along the lines of "I paid for two day shipping; you promised it's arrival, its not here you should fix this." They offered me 20 dollars off my next order or a month of prime for free. 


I didn't accept that and insisted that I had needed it on the day that it was supposed to arrive. The text chat guy didn't do anything so I rang up the # on their site and talked to a human who gave me the item for free + 20 dollars off my next order and a month of prime.

Amazon support is really good. Take advantage of it.The agency I used to work for offered a whopping three days if you worked for them for six months and a whole FIVE days if you worked there a year. The person acted like they were being overly generous when she described that “perk”. Temp agencies are an easy way to get a job quick, just don’t expect it to be a good one or to be paid/treated well :/Never forget it was the FCC that made it all but illegal to be a small ISP several years agoIt's illegal in the US too, but just like in other countries, it's difficult to regulate.  Good on you lad, i feel bad for all the career retail folks, its really horrid industry. The thing is, it could be a decent job with the right managers (ultimately its just running a store that shouldn't be so bad) but it just seems like all the turds float to the top and make it unpleasant for the people below. I've had several positions now where I was asked to write my own job description about a year after starting the role, because "we want to hire another you."

While writing the job descriptions I found myself thinking that I probably wouldn't have met these criteria when I started doing the job in the first place. This made me wonder how they expected to find someone when a) the job hadn't existed before I started doing it, b) my managers didn't know enough about what I did to be able to write the job description, and c) that some of the skills they were looking for probably weren't being cultivated by people they could afford to hire for the role.The new American motto!Worked 3 service jobs in the US.

You can also report them to your county and state labor relations boards - firing someone for doing something that it is ILLEGAL to prevent them from doing is about the quickest way to a sanction that there is, and there are few things more expensive than a wrongful termination suit. :-\ I worked for a small public library system that enforced this. It was also a 'major' employer in an extremely rural area. They would even try to avoid disclosing the salary information to official requests that they were legally required to disclose...Just like Warren Buffet used to say: "the more you learn, the more you earn 8 nickels."As a mechanical engineer I had to hand write a bunch of code for that interview.

I am getting laid off because my department was relocated and I couldn’t move because of my wife’s job.

I have been doing my job from the old office which still has lots of employees from other departments in it for about 4 months without issue.  I just found out I am being laid off at the end of the year so HR can clean up their records.  Basically they just laid off everyone who didn’t accept the relocation.  HR doesn’t care that 3 of my projects are going into mass production in late January and I am supposed to oversee that.  They just wanted to clean up their records.  
You're not wrong, but this is shady as fuck.  If I'm interviewing with a company and they want to see my *pay slips* from my current employer, they can fuck right off.  I wouldn't work for anyone who tries to justify my value using another company's salary information.  

Plus, a pay slip will not show your total annual pay - just your hourly rate.  Between bonuses, travel differentials, and non-monetary perks, your take-home salary is likely to be much higher than your hourly rate x 40 x 52.

She never did, but instead abused me in any way she could. Working grill(where you have to run around a lot) in the middle of summer when my allergies cause my asthma to flare up but refuse me a chance to go get an inhaler, fuck yeah she'd do it.

They played hardball with me when I was cord cutting last december for the first few rounds.  THEN they tried to save themselves.

The first line of defense was to not have any special offers, but requiring me to transfer to continue my cancellation.

Second line of defense says they're not sure why they told me they couldn't offer a better package. When I hold stout they tell me they can't actually cancel and have to transfer me to another dept.

Third line of defense offered the best deals, but I really just wanted internet.  They finally cancelled my TV service.

So it really doesnt at all back up the notion that the FCC "made being a small ISP illegal a few years ago."I was on a tour bus with my grandmother going to a luau in Hawaii, my grandmother spoke fluent Italian as both her parents were Italian immigrants. Two young women behind us were speaking to each other in Italian, probably assuming none of the other tourists could understand them. My grandmother told me (I don't speak but a few words in Italian) that they were insulting everyone on the bus. She let it go on a while but just kept getting angrier and angrier as the ride went on. Finally she turned around and told them off, telling them they should be ashamed of themselves for being so rude. They looked so embarrassed and apologized to her profusely. Getting told off by a grandmother on a tour bus was not what they expected. This happened to my brother and father while they were traveling. Some dude walks up to my brother, thinking he is a local, and starts talking to him in Farsi. When he realized my brother didn't understand, started saying really rude things, about him and my dad being stupid. My dad (fluent in Farsi) comes over, and rips this asshole a second one. The dude feigned being apologetic, and made excuses for his attitude. As he was walking away, he started muttering more foul things about them, but in Turkish this time. Dad speaks Turkish as well, and  proceeds to rip him a third asshole.

tl:dr - There is a man with three assholes. Was on both ends as a deaf person myself.

 on one side: This one time the cashiers at a store realized I was deaf, and so started talking to each other about me when they thought I wasn't looking... they also didn't know I had my hearing aids and could lipread. Their comments weren't anything too negative, it was mostly the typical comments about deaf people by people who were completely clueless about how deafness worked.
  When I brought my stuff to the checkout I kindly reminded them that it's a pretty bad idea to talk about somebody thinking that they can't understand what you're talking about... because the chances are that they do in fact understand what you're talking about.
   The look on their faces were completely classic.

on the other side: One time my best friend and I were people watching at the mall, and we randomly started rating the men around us. In sign language, of course. There was this one dude sitting near us and we start rating his looks and his body. I said that he looked like he had a nice butt, and that his eyes were really beautiful, with the color of the deep ocean. so I rated him a 10/10.
  Then he came over to us,and then told us in sign language: "Thanks for the compliments, ladies. you really made my day, haha."
 We were both so shocked and embarrassed. heh.The people at the Chinese food place on my campus spoke Chinese to the door exchange students. But even tho I spoke Chinese I just always spoke English to them since I have an accent when I speak Chinese. But one day I got all meat no rice since I had a rice maker at home. And when I was paying the lady says to the person beside her "fat ass wants meat no rice". And I responded in Chinese, "actually I have rice at home". They didn't charge me for the order and started giving me a bit extra whenever I go there

Edit: didn't see all the replies, but everyone saying they probably wernt saying it in an insulting way is correct. They were saying "fat ass", more along the lines of fatty, or tubby. (pon zi, I think that's the phonetic spelling of what they said? Not really sure how to spell it tbh) I'm fluent in Spanish and was in a bank line in Lima ~~the capital of a South American City~~  and these two early middle aged women were in front of me have a mostly quiet chat. One was telling the other about this new young guy at work she was banging and describing all the crazy sex they were having, going into detail about all sorts of stuff. 

The other wanted to know what he looked like and she was kind of describing him badly, and she kinda did a sly look around the bank, waited a few seconds and said in Spanish: "he looks like this guy behind us, but with blonde hair, much better looking and a much better dresser." She did a good job of not gesturing towards me when she said it, but it didn't stop me from hearing it.

So she goes back to discussing details about hooking up with him at work and they don't notice the line has moved, and so without a warning throat clear I just say: "we all love the details back here but can you move forward?"

She went white as a ghost and they didn't really talk for the rest of the wait, it was hilarious

Edit: Me can't write goodWas in Germany, and a middle school teacher asked me to come in as a guest for one of her English classes. The teacher introduced me, I said hello and that I was from the U.S. and happy to be in their class.

The teacher said "So do you have any questions in English for an American? What do you think an American is like?" 

One of the kids near the front says in german, kind of under his breath but definitely loud enough that most of the class can hear, "fat and stupid!" 

The kids laugh, the teacher turns bright red. I don't know what to do, so I just say "Of course, many Americans can speak German" in German.

The kid almost shit himself. He looked like a baby deer that had wandered onstage at a Beyonce concert.

I thought he was just being a dick and had intended me to understand what he was saying. Apparently though he actually hadn't thought through that an American in Germany in their language class might actually speak their language.We had a large family reunion dinner at a restaurant and we were all sharing stories. My funny Uncle was telling us how he used to pretend he was deaf and his sister would translate. 
To prove it, he asked the waitress to get the manager. When he came over, my Uncle started signing to him...with made up and exaggerated gestures. My Aunt told him that the food was good and the server was excellent...all the while the manager just smiled and nodded. 
When they were done “talking”, the manager said in sign language, he spoke ASL and knew it was bullshit. 
We blew up laughing and my Uncles face turned beet red. I was in a hotel elevator with my wife in Osaka Japan. The Miyako Mariott to exact. It is a popular hotel for tourists. We were going up the elevator to our room on the 54th floor? It's a high hotel. In the elevator with us is a Chinese family that speaks Cantonese. They must have assumed we were Japanese or some other type of asian because they started to tease their pre-teen daughter about how badly she need to take a shit. They were laughing and the mother was teasing her about how "I can almost see it coming out!" our floor came first and when it did I turned to them and said "goodnight" in Cantonese. Their face was priceless and we got out of the elevator. My wife called me a jackass while laughing her ass off. Then we got back to our rooms and took a shit too.When I was stationed in Korea, I was getting a haircut and the hairdresser had like an assistant or a new person helping her get me seated and prepared. She says to the main girl "He looks like a baby!" (I have a baby face and was like 22 at the time). I responded in Korean with, "I look like a baby?" 

She was really startled and embarrassed and noped out of there for the rest of the haircut. The main hairdresser took advantage of being able to talk with me in Korean, though. 

Edit: added a letterNice Story: I am 100% white and look very European and was travelling South Korea with my also very European looking Spanish friend but we both speak conversational level Korean. As we were walking around a park in Daegu (fairly large city south of Seoul), a bunch of seniors in the park were talking about how pretty we were. We turned around and thanked them in Korean, and they were very taken aback and then asked us where we were from. After telling them they said: "If everyone is as pretty you two, I want to go there." Made our day as they were so sweet.

Funny story: I went to an Asian dollar store in Jeju, South Korea. All my friends checked out first, but they were all East Asian looking. The cashiers dealt with them as normal. When I get to the till, the guy noticeably pales and then turns to his coworker in panic. "Dude, I don't speak English, What do I do?"
Coworker: "Just deal with it."
Guy: "I don't speak English, but I can speak Chinese"
Coworker: "you speak Chinese?! I didn't know that"
Guy: "hey (3rd person opposite the tills) do you speak English, help me!!"
Guy 3: "dude just deal with it!"
Me: ".....it's okay... I speak Korean"
The look on his face was hilarious.

I also have a lot of stories of Koreans shit talking me, but weirdly enough most of them are from here in Canada.
My girlfriend and I live in Ottawa, Canada. I grew up speaking French my whole life, and she knows enough to understand others speaking. We were in a restaurant, which was relatively empty except for us and another very French couple at a table nearby (close enough to hear their conversation). Eventually the other girl started talking about my girlfriend's clothing, saying things like 'mauvais choix' (bad choice). I suspect they were visiting from Quebec and just didn't realize that most people here speak a bit of French, but as we were leaving, I turned to them and said 'bonne journée!' ('good day!'). The look on her face still pops into my head occasionally and it makes everything feel right in the world.Hearing girl here. 

I was looking for something in Target and asked an employee for help. She was busy stocking shelves and I kept trying to verbally get her attention. When she finally noticed me she mouthed, “I’m Deaf.” 

I set my stuff down to free up my hands, introduced myself, and asked her where what I was looking for was in American Sign Language. Her face completely lit up, and I’ll never forget it.

Communication is major for Deaf people because they are unfortunately often excluded from the hearing world, which is probably why this lady reacted the way she did. Though this was minor, it made a huge impact on me. This instance made me fall in love with sign language all over again and realize how communication is a basic human right that many people do not have or have limited access to. My family and I went to Sri Lanka for two weeks to see where my mom grew up and general beach stuff. For some reason we were like the only people in the hotel we were staying at aside from a wedding party that left a day after we got there.

A few days in there was another family staying there, I believe from Suriname and we were all chilling at the pool and decided to play a game of water polo against each other. Things got exciting and one of the daughters yelled out something in Dutch like "go for the big fat guy!", my Dutch dad replied "what big fat guy?", And everybody laughed.

Just a simple story but it was pretty sweet.A lady on the bus was being a bitch and slagging people off in Greek until she got to me. She was being excessively nasty about my chipped nail varnish, I don’t know either maybe she was having a bad day. As soon as I clocked it I turned around and looked her dead in the eye with my very Greek face and she stopped. She then sat in the seat in front of me where I sat and called my mom, also Greek, who I had a conversation with for the duration of the bus journey about the rude lady who slagged my nails off because she thought I couldn’t understand, in Greek. It was delicious.I was in an elevator going back up to my apartment after working out some two years ago and I had a man bun at that time. There were 6 other guys in the elevator speaking Arabic so I just listened as I usually do. Then, one of the guys goes, "Haha. Look at this guys hair. It's ridiculous."

I turn around and respond, "You want to say that again?"

The five other dudes proceed to die of laughter with one of them screaming, "I knew you were Arab! I knew you were Arab!"

I ended up laughing along side them to their one friend who felt super awkward.I once interviewed for a part-time school holiday job, together with a good friend of mine. My friend is Chinese, the majority race of the country I live in. I, however, am quite clearly not. 

The first thing the HR manager says when he sees me is "We need someone who speaks Mandarin", a criterion not stated anywhere in the employment ad, and which subtly translates to "Chinese candidates preferred".

My friend, while ethnically Chinese, speaks little to no Mandarin. I, on the other hand, speak it rather fluently.

Probably as a test, the HR manager decides to field us questions in Mandarin, clearly intent on cutting me out of the interview.

My friend turns pale, as he stumbles along to answer the question posed in whatever halting Mandarin he can scrape together.

The manager then turns to me, rather arrogantly, waiting for my reply.

It gave me great joy to tell him straight to his face "Thank you for the opportunity, but clearly I am not the right candidate you are looking for to fill this position since I am not Chinese" in crisp fluent Mandarin. 

The look of bewilderment of his face was priceless. Back in 2010, I was at the Hmong New Year in St. Paul/Minneapolis with my family where this happened. This event is pretty big and there used to be literally thousands of Hmong people there, it's an event where we basically celebrate our heritage. I am Hmong (Southeast Asian), but I look like I'm Hispanic just to give you some background. Anyways, I had to go to the bathroom because y'know, I'm only human and all. When I went to go wash my hands, these two older guys (probably about 35-40) come in and as soon as they see me, they say something (in Hmong) along the lines of, "These damn Mexicans thinking they can come to our New Year. Maybe we should call the cops to take him back home to Mexico, hahahahahaha." Well, in comes my cousin by sheer luck so I ask him in Hmong, "Hey, where did you guys go? Last time I saw you guys was at the ball tossing area (it's this weird courting activity that involves throwing a tennis ball/softball while flirting)." We end our very short conversation and then as I was exiting the bathroom, I made absolutely sure that I gave the most judgemental look ever to those two men. It worked like a charm and you could tell by their facial expressions that they knew they messed up.
EDIT: GrammarI’m Brazilian and was flying to Rio from Atlanta. There were these two very attractive girls with their mother speaking English very fluently and one of them had their seat right next to mine. We exchanged some courtesy in English as I just assumed they were American and so did they. They were Brazilian-Americans and so did not have an accent and I started speaking English from a young age so as long as I don’t talk too much I can go unnoticed.

So they start putting their carry on luggage in the bin overhead and the mother says to her daughters, in Portuguese:

“Coitado, tá achando que vou deixar uma de vocês sentar do lado dele.”

Which means

“Poor thing, he thinks I’ll let one of you sit next to him.”

So I just turn to her and say, in Portuguese:

“Don’t worry, ma’am, I’m just being polite. I do have a girlfriend and it’ll be a pleasure to share this flight with you.”

She just went: “oh”

And then she sat there in silence for the whole flight.
Most of these stories are a bit negative, here's a lighter one. 

My mum's a linguist and speaks about 15 languages fluently and as such, I picked up a couple along the way. Most of my childhood was spent in Germany so I have a firm grasp of the language...which doesn't really seem to match my appearance. I'm a 6'3, 220lbs, black man, who speaks German. Now this isn't too uncommon a sight in Germany, but in North America, I'm a fucking unicorn. 

So I was standing at the bus stop one day in the heart of downtown Toronto and there were these two 60-something year old German ladies who were not having a good time. They were trying to find the Art Gallery and were fed up with the fact that they were having such a shitty time navigating because their english-speaking children had left them alone for the day.

I didn't have anything particularly important planned for that day, so I turned to them and said something to the effect of "You know, our city has a lot to offer if you know where to look. Would you two like me to show you where the Gallery is, and a couple places you can get lunch along the way" 

They nearly fainted. They were sooooo happy that they found someone who spoke German and couldn't stop taking pictures with me to show their family 'the guy that saved their day'. I walked them to the Gallery and gave them a bit of an impromptu walking/bus tour along the way. That was the day I gained two Omas.

EDIT: Thank you so much for the gold kind stranger! And remember, help those you can! :) Some guys on the subway started talking about their 백마타는꿈 (Dream of Riding the White Horse aka fantasy about fucking a white girl) right next to me (mixed Korean/American but totally white looking). I waited until I was about to exit, then tapped their shoulder and suggested a few clubs for them to go to and try out next time. Told them they better be good at English though because everyone knows, white girls can't speak Korean. I might have heard an old man laugh behind me as I exited the train.My family and I were flying to Greece from Houston to visit family, and two groups are also on this 10hr flight: student ambassador middle/high schoolers, mostly girls, from the US, and a youth male Greek soccer team. And of course, they were all sitting by us with their chaperones at the other end of the plane.

The boys are hitting on and flirting with these girls about 2-4 yrs younger than them, all over each other. They moved seats so they can sit with the girls, and they were so loud amd obnoxious the whole plane was pissed off (except the crew who did fuck all about it apparently).

The boys were also talking amongst themselves in Greek. My mother speaks fluently from years of Greek school and many a summer raised in the Peloponese hillside.

At some point, while all 3 of us are just sitting there reading, sleeping, trying to watch the tiny tv at the front of the plane and listen over this kids constantly talking, my mother jumps up and goes over to the group and says:

"These boys are calling you fat and stupid. They also think American girls are so easy. By the way he (she points at the one guy who was the most all over this one girl) is 18. They have girlfriends waiting for them in the terminal. Now shut up so I can sleep"

They all shuffled back to their appropriate seats, silent. Best flight ever after that. 

I love my mom.

Edit: Thanks everyone for the kind comments! My mom is so happy, but still really pissed off about the flight attendants who did nothing. She's ready to adopt all of you (she adopts everybody, don't get too excited)!My cousin is a big white guy who studied for 2 years in Japan during college. He worked for one of the head of Honda America for a few years. When the head guy learned that he spoke Japanese, he would make sure my cousin was in all the meetings and phone conferences with the Japanese branch. My cousin would listen to everything the Japanese would be saying to each other and report it to his boss during breaks. As such the boss looked like a psychic to the Japanese because after break he would address their concerns without being prompted. The boss made mad bonuses every quarter and always funneled a bunch of that to my cousin.

EDIT: I have never seen Click so not from that. This is based off my memory of him telling me this about 15 years ago so don't  know how precisely accurate it is.When I was teaching kids in Japan, I would only respond with "English only" to their Japanese, I did this for a few reasons:
1. To make them think I didn't speak Japanese.
2. To make them use English more.
3. So I could scare the crap out of them once I decided to speak Japanese.

Some kid in English school didn't do his homework, when I asked him for it, he told me in English that he "forgot" his book. He then turns to his classmate and says in Japanese that his book is in his bag and he didn't do his homework because he couldn't be bothered. I said nothing.

Come the end of the class, his mother is waiting in the reception, along with my Japanese manager, so I tell the manager in English that he didn't do his homework, I hear the conversation between kid and mom - with him giving the same "forgot" bullshit.

So, I just say in perfect Japanese "Why are you saying you forgot the book? When I asked you in the class, you told the other student that it's in your bag and you didn't do the homework, because you couldn't be bothered. I'm sorry, didn't you know that I could understand Japanese?"

Mom opens the bag, finds the book, smacks the kid in the head with the book and tells him to sit in the reception doing his homework. Kid cries. All is good.I sort of have the reverse of this.

I am a white man from the UK, and whilst visiting Berlin was sat on on the S-Bahn facing a older (also white) lady.

On the other side of the carriage there were 4 gentlemen who where clearly eastern European / middle eastern. I *think* they were speaking Turkish but I'm not sure.

The lady turns to me and says in German, something along the lines of "Beschämend, innen Deutschland sprechen wir Deutsch" (Shameful, In Germany we Speak German). Loud enough they were supposed to hear, clearly looking for me to agree with her.

To which I replied in my very broken German "Ich bin English, mein Deutsch ist sehr schlecht" or I'm English, my German is very bad.

Her face went bright red.Here's one where everyone felt good at the end.

When I was living in China, I used to run in this giant park. One morning on one of my runs, I see these three young men hanging out by the path. Not too many foreigners in the area, not too many joggers either, so they immediately notice and start talking about me.

One guy says, "Is she Russian?" There was a small but significant Russian population in the city, so, not a bad guess.

Another guy: "Talk to her!"

First guy: "Nah, she wouldn't understand."

By this time I'm right next to these guys, and I yelled over my shoulder "Yes, I *do!*" as I ran past.

They absolutely lost their shit. I could still hear them laughing after I went around the bend.I recently went to Japan for my first ever international trip and was totally prepared to have to struggle through all my day-to-day interactions in Japanese but was surprised at how widespread even a basic understanding of English is over there. Everyone assumes you won’t speak any Japanese at all so they stick to as much English as they’re comfortable with or you basically just play charades. 

At a restaurant in Kobe, the waitress was practically fluent in English so we chatted a while and it came up that I’m studying Japanese so we had a little small talk and she was impressed. Then the owner came over to talk but wasn’t as confident in his English so he had the waitress translate. He was asking all these questions about where we’d been so far, where we were staying, how we liked everything, if we’d been down to Kobe Port yet, etc. It was simple enough that I understood 100% without her translation, and the waitress could tell. Finally, she says to him, in Japanese “By the way, he understands what you’re saying.” His eyes practically bugged out of his head and he got SUPER excited and asked if we wouldn’t mind waiting 30 minutes for him to close up and send everyone home. 

So, I wait, he closes everything up and we all end up hanging out that night. He drove us around the city, bought us drinks, even drove back to the AirBNB. Japan is amazing. 

EDIT:

I forget my handle on here is still Zhongguo, I am actually a 6’2 bald white dude - so very noticeably foreign in Japan. I’ve always loved Asian cultures and in high school people called me Zhongguo because I was the only one in my history class who kept acing the Chinese exams. 

For anyone thinking about going to Japan, even if you don’t speak any Japanese, DO IT. It’s the most beautiful country filled with the nicest people. 

EDIT 2:

The restaurant’s name was Hanasato in Kobe. It’s a short walk from one of the JR stations. The food was amazing as well. I was with my french friend in a corner shop when he was visiting me in Manchester, UK His English is really bad so we were speaking french.
2 guys were behind us in the queue, my friend told me he wanted to try and speak english to the guy on the till so I let him. He asked for something in broken english and the till guy didn't understand him so he asked him to repeat. At this point the guys behind us were getting frustrated and one of them said "fucking foreigners, they should just go home to where they came from" I turned around and told them I am home and hes trying his best and told them they were assholes. The 2nd guy seemed embarrassed like he didn't share the same views though.

I don't understand people like that at all. They go to Spain on holiday and speak english to everyone and when someone visits their country and try to speak it's still not good enough. Took the employee shuttle with a bunch of my South American exchange student coworkers. For about a month I slept in the back while they conversed in Spanish. One day, they told a joke and I laughed out loud, then they all stopped and looked at me, realizing that I could understand Spanish the whole time. This really broke the ice between us, and some of them became lifelong friends and it led to a romantic relationship as well.American expat in Thailand.

I have a beard.  On many occasions, people will say something like "Monkey! Monkey!" or "You want a banana?" or other similar comments.  Most times, I just ignore it as I don't want people to know I speak some Thai.  Once, after an excessive amount of monkey comments, I smiled at the people (two young girls, about 14 or so) and said "Monkeys don't have blue eyes.  Monkeys have black eyes, just like you two."  They were speechless.
Cable Guy here. Being a white guy, most people don't realize that I know how to speak and write in Spanish. I run into so many situations where I can run under the radar and just do my job without someone knowing that I can understand them completely. Every once in a while I subtly let them know that I can understand them.

I was doing an instillation at a house where the family 'only spoke Spanish' and the order requested for a Spanish speaking tech. I showed up to the door, the husband opened the door, and automatically assumed that I couldn't speak Spanish. His English was near perfect and he greeted me, showed me around and where he wanted everything. He let me do my work as he walked into the other room where his buddy was an automatically started talking shit about me.

 'I can't believe they sent a fucking white guy who can't speak Spanish. I specifically told them to send someone who can speak Spanish so I didn't have to deal with this bullshit. He's going to be lazy as fuck and not do the job right. I bet the asshole is going to expect a tip after doing a shitty job and I'll have to fix it myself' -the dude went on and on the entire time I was there, talking shit the entire time.

At the end of the appointment, I was pissed. I didn't show it, but he thought it was funny to talk shit in front of me, smile on his face while acting like he wasn't saying anything about me.. so I looked at him, told him in Spanish 'your instillation is done. If you have any questions you can call the company yourself and they'll be able to get someone who speaks Spanish to help you.'

He looked at me with a shocked expression, so I continued, 'next time you should ask if the person can speak Spanish before talking shit.' His buddy hit the floor laughing as I left the customer standing there feeling like a jackass.I went to a psychiatric emergency ward once and asked for help and if they were comfortable to speak English.

I understand Danish but have a hard time making myself understandable in it and didn't really feel like an idiot at a crucial time of my life.

I stayed there for 4 days without anyone realising I knew what they were saying about me right in front of me.

2 of the nurses thought I was cute.

1 doctor thought I was lying all the time.

A patient thought I was a spy for the staff. 


A lot happened in those 4 days


It made my stay way more enjoyable then it should have been.When I started working at McDonald's at 16, none of the other employees realized I could speak a fair amount of Spanish. A few of my coworkers would talk crap about me in Spanish and I pretended for a few weeks that I didn't know what they were saying. 

Then one day a manager told me she was worth me than me because she was bilingual.  So I told her (in Spanish) that I was actually trilingual. The looks on their faces when they realized I spoke Spanish all along was priceless. My family is Cuban, but we look white af.  In 2007, I was on a cruise with my parents, and we were sitting next to a Venezuelan couple on the open-air deck ordering food.  The woman was looking at my parents, and loudly said in Spanish 

“He’s so OLD!  Why would a young woman like her marry him? Do you think the child is theirs?”

Her husband replies “No, probably he is the father’s.  He’s too old to be the woman’s. Too ugly too.”

My mother got very upset and just said “Excuse me” in Spanish.   The woman’s face turned white and she started apologizing profusely.  While my mother was telling them off, my dad was laughing his ass off.

For the record, my parents are ~3 years apart.  My dad is only three years older, he just looks ancient.  At the time, my mother was 47 and my father was 50.Me and my sister are Hungarian but grew up in England and speak fluent Hungarian and English with natural accents. We'd also spend most of our summers growing up in Hungary where since we speak English perfectly people assumed in public we were from England and would occasionally say something mean or negative not expecting us to understand. There's few things more satisfying than replying in perfect Hungarian 'What did you say?' and watching people's eyes widen in panic and profusely apologize. Oh I LOVE this one: 
So I was working at a dental clinic in Germany, and these 2 guys walk in and start speaking in arabic, not knowing that both I and my supervisor can understand it. 
The first guy (actual patient) is nervously telling his friend and this would never work, and his friend is telling him to shut up and play along, so the supervisor and I try to figure out what kinda game they're trying to play.
Apparently, they were trying to lie about the patient's age to get his dental treatment done for free; (I dont know how that worked, I was just an intern) unlucky for him, his teeth told the truth (you cant fake being 16 when your wisdom teeth are ALL THE WAY out) 

So me and my supervisor shut up about it, and I'm in actual pain trying to hold back from laughing as the friend is convincing the patient that we're idiots who dont speak arabic and cant understand their trick. Of course until i cant anymore and decide to discuss the case with my supervisor. Right there in front of them. In arabic. 

I have never seen someone turn so many different colours so fast.

EDIT apparently all you people are weird and got wisdom teeth at weird ages; asked my professors and they said at around 12 is the lowest they've seen, and even that is because of precocious puberty (from what they've seen).
This is suoer interesting though so if you have any xrays pm me what age you were when you took them and you can be my special case project of the year :)I was living in Amsterdam as a nanny and I was taking Dutch classes. After about 6 months I got pretty good at understanding the language including the slang even though I couldn’t produce it verbally very well yet. Well I went to meet up with some guy friends of mine (who were Dutch college-aged males) and they all started talking to their buddies in Dutch (RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME) about all the sex acts I’d performed on them and how I had a 4 person orgy with them (with 3 guys and 1 Girl I don’t even know how that would work but I’m sure Reddit can come up with an answer for me). I immediately said to them to never talk to me again and they repeatedly attempted to apologize via text but I never spoke to them again. I had no other friends for a while but getting rid of those losers was worth the loneliness.I used to work at gun store. Two guys come in, speaking Spanish to one another, with one guy translating for the other. I'm a 6'5" goofy looking Irish dude, so they had no way of knowing I lived in Mexico for two years as a teen. 

So the whole time I hear the guy describing the gun he wants, how much her likes it, etc to the translator. Translator tells me everything like he is the one who wants to buy the gun. He says he brought the other guy because he "knows guns" Finally I hear the Spanish only guy say that this is the one he wants, translator then tells me he has decided which gun he wants.

I let them know, in Spanish, that I wouldn't be selling them any guns. What they were trying is called a Straw purchase and is very illegal.I sometimes volunteer in a local charity shop and although I don't speak much Welsh, I understand a lot. So I know if people are dissing the special needs volunteers in Welsh, or assume that I have special needs. If they buy something, I respond in Welsh. That usually shuts them up. And because I have Swedish family and know the odd phrase, any Swedish tourists we get coming in are quite impressed that I can identify them as such and say thank you in their language. Said something like "You need to be careful when talking shit about someone in your native language, there might always be someone who understands you" in German while I was in Italy. A woman who was walking by responded "Like me for example".

Edit: thank you so much for gold, kind stranger![deleted]I lived in South Korea for three years, but I never learned too much of the language. A friend of mine is 100% Korean but is very tall and was educated in America and New Zealand so she has an American accent. Her co-teachers at her school all assumed she couldn’t speak Korean so they would talk shit about her constantly while she would listen on and feel terrible. She said nothing for a whole year until she had to speak at the end of year ceremony. The school offered her someone to translate but she refused and in front of 800 or so students and faculty members she delivered her address in perfect Korean. She subtly called out the coworkers that had spent an entire year calling her a foreign pig. Apparently one started crying from the shame of it. I wish I had got to see that.My grandmother, who grew up in a Yiddish speaking household, but does not look particularly Jewish, lives in an area near a large Hasidic community. She has many stories of people saying all sorts of things in Yiddish assuming that she can’t understand but I have one particular favorite.

She was in the supermarket and a little Hasidic boy of about 3 or 4 is wandering around, clearly lost. He sort of nuzzles up against her skirt and says “Mama mama,” in Yiddish. She replies in Yiddish that she’s not his mom but he can come with her and they’ll find her together. The little kid looks up at her with a look of horror and runs away screaming “Mama Mama! The shikse speaks Yiddish!”I'm from the US and when I was 11 my family went to France for a couple weeks. My dad was a very smart man. He graduated college when he was 18 and had a love for languages. He was fluent in French, Spanish, and German and he lived in France for a year or two. He came back to the US and taught French for a few years before getting his JD and PharmD, He was constantly trying to teach us French whenever he could when we were little. 

He kept in touch with his French professor from college and when we were in France we stayed with them in St. Hilaire de Riez. They had a small party with some of their friends and everyone sat around talking and drinking wine. As much as he tried to teach us French, we could only do as much as ordering food and reading restaurant menus and such, so everyone was talking in English except for one man's wife that was there and didn't speak English. The hosts were translating most things for her.

At one point, the man says something in French like "Americans don't value things like learning foreign languages." Not knowing my dad spoke French. My dad looks at him and in French replies something along the lines of "You're right, lots of Americans aren't introduced to foreign languages until they are older and already out of the prime time of their life to start learning." And that this was why he started teaching his kids French as early as possible and even why he brought his kids to France, hoping that we'd gain an appreciation for another language and culture. I didn't know what the guy had said or what my dad had said until after we left, but I remember the look on the guys face and how he was clearly apologizing repeatedly. The host laughed too and explained my dads history with French and his education. To say the man was embarrassed would be an understatement.

Friday will be 13 years since my dad passed away at 55 years old. He was such an awesome person and loved by everyone he met. He would never take offense to something even like that guy. He was from a tiny southern town in the middle of nowhere and grew up with nothing and worked his ass off to get where he was in life. Cancer is a bitch.  :(I have a reverse story.
Deep in the night I leave work, small road on a small city in rural China so no public lightning . I go by the side of the road until a taxi comes by.
Finally find one, we spend the next 15min speaking about all and nothing (weather, road repairs and so on). We arrive at my residence, the driver open the front light to help count the cash

Blood curdling scream. 

The driver start « you’re not Chinese !»
Me: Not last time I checked.

Nota: i am not the scary type, 75kg white nerd wearing pants and dress shirt.I was shopping with friends for clothes and these two ladies that worked at the store were outside of my fitting room speaking in spanish. They kept criticizing me for taking so long to try on clothes and referrd to me as "dumb gringo" and jokingly asked me if I needed any assistance (in english). They didn't realize I was hispanic until I came out of the room and responded in spanish that no, I didn't need their help. They got so red.

Edit: somehow it’s not clear to people that I responded “no, I don’t need your help” rather than just “no”Went to a tradeshow in Prague and I went out for dinner and drinks with a client and my boss. As we were waiting for a cab, I stepped away for a moment to snap a picture.

When I walked back, my boss and client were talking to about half a dozen tipsy blonde girls, danish blonde girl I realised as I get close enough to hear them speak. As it turns out, I speak Danish (ex wife's Danish).

I listened for a bit to what they were saying. Typical drunk people stuff: let's go out with them, this one's cute, not me I'm tired etc.

I finally opened up and started chatting in (crude-ish) Danish with them. Minds were blown. The Danes were surprised that some random dude actually spoke their language but also my boss and client, who had no idea. The look on their faces were priceless. Flemish guy here. Working as safari guide in Kruger area, South Africa. 

One time, my boss asks me to go pick a family of 4 up at the Klaserie reserve gate, do an afternoon game drive with them, and drop them off again afterwards. This was very uncommon; normally we only do game drives with people that book a room in our own lodge on the reserve. 

So I pick them up, introduce myself and go over the rules, all in English. They reply in English, or at least: the dad does, and normally I can pick up straight away if it's someone from France, Belgium, Holland or Germany. But his English was Oxford English. So I thought; English people. Off we went!

10 minutes into the game drive I hear them speak in Flemish, and not only that, IN MY OWN DIALECT. Side note; every Flemish town has a dialect, we can hear what region/province other Flemish people are from, and if from the same region, we can often even pinpoint the exact little town or community they are from.

Oooh I was going to have fun with these folks! Found a few nice animal sightings, spoke English all the time, but then one sentence to the next, switched to their exact dialect. I thought; now they're going to be surprised! But nope... we all kept chatting in Flemish now. Only 20 minutes later, the daughter, maybe 10 years old, goes "wait a minute; he speaks Flemish!" 

After all had a good laugh, I asked them where they were from. They literally lived one street away from me. It's a small world, folks!

Edit; oh wow! Gold! Gold! I am one of "those" Redactors now! Thank you kindly, stranger!My friend and I both come from Spanish speaking families, and we would speak in Spanish when we didn't want people to know what we were talking about. One time we were in my kitchen with my mom and my idiot friend started asking me in Spanish if I wanted to go outside and smoke weed.So I don't speak Spanish fluently, but I understand it just fine.  I used to sell cars in Houston and as you can imagine, we had a lot of bilingual Spanish speakers come to buy cars from us. They never asked if my super clean cut white guy self spoke Spanish, so I never told them I did. 

It was fun to have a couple that would speak English to me and Spanish to each other. They would literally tell each other everything like how much they wanted to pay and their negotiating tactics... They would say things like, "if he offers to take $500 off lets do it, but I'm going to ask for $1000".  

So once they said yes, inevitability one would ask the other a product question in Spanish and I'd jump in and answer in English. The looks on their faces when they have that "a-ha" moment were priceless.

Edit - Side note: I used my powers for good too... Like me (only the other way around), many Spanish speakers understand English just fine but don't speak it well.  I've done entire car deals where I spoke English and they spoke Spanish with no issues and they became happy customers. 

RIP - my inboxSo I was at the hospital with my grandmother, waiting for a blood test. My grandmother and I were talking in our native language when suddenly these two ladies sitting across me where wondering why we "foreigners" won't speak English. My dad called me after a few minutes sitting in the waiting room wondering how things were going in the hospital. I responded to him in english. It was funny to see their faces become red and laughing it off. I once worked as a door to door salesman for a concentrated multi surface cleaner made from enzymes or somesuch. I get it, people don’t like being bugged at home, but just tell me that and I’ll be on my way with a “Sorry for bugging you at home.” Don’t lie to me. 

This one guy one day interrupted my pitch with “No hablo Inglés.” So I backtracked, apologized and began my sales pitch, completely en Españolish. When he heard a couple of sentences of this, he said, “No thank you, we don’t want any cleaner.” To which I replied, “No hablo Inglés.”Im swiss and peruvian and live in peru, so i don't look at all like a swiss guy.

There were two swiss girls sitting behind me on a bus talking about latino guys. Then one of them asked the other if she found me attractive. I turned around and said that I would love to know that too. The look of confusion and shame was priceless. Then we just all laughed. Now I've got two new friends!

Edit: They were speaking swiss german (schwiizerdütsch)

Edit 2: They both later confessed that they found me attractive While I'm Spanish, I don't quite look like the stereotypical Spaniard: light skin colour, blondeish, green eyes... 

When I was living in London I got into several situations like that. The top one was on the tube back home. I think there was a football game (Chelsea - Barcelona) and this couple was going to the stadium and I was standing just besides them. Tube had a hard stop and I accidentally fell a bit over one of them. I apologised in English as I didn't realise they were Spaniards too.

They started talking to each other saying "this fucking fat cunt nearly smashed in the ground" and things of the sort for almost 5 minutes.

When they left the tube and he looked at me one last time laughing I told him in perfect Spanish "enjoy the game, you little piece of shit". His face going pale as the doors were closing was enough satisfaction for a week.

Edit: Jesus my most upvoted comment ever it's about being an angry Spaniard. Who would have thought.I'm American, but can read and speak Russian on an intermediate level. A few years ago while visiting St. Petersburg, I was buying tickets for the hydrofoil to Peterhof. All the signs at the ticket booth were in Russian, and I could read the ticket prices. The ticket agent assumed I didn't know Russian, and tried to tell me the ticket cost three times more than the stated price. I looked her right in the eye and said in Russian, "I see on the board here that the ticket I want is (x) rubles." Her jaw dropped, and the ticket agent sitting next to her started laughing her ass off.Not me, but a friend of mine happend that. She is half-italian, and when she was in university, an italian exchange-student was skyping with a friend at home. Because she thought nobody understood her she started to speak quite loud and quite detailed about her recent sexual encounters.Famous story by my grandfather who spoke Arabic and French.

He was in Kuwait with his wife and 20 dollars to his name, applying for a job with a big hotel company I believe the Marriott. He interviews all in Arabic and he waits in the lobby to talk to the final guy for the job. Two of his previous interviewers walk past him and say in French “what’s he still doing here he didn’t get the job?” My grandfather then stands up and says “if I didn’t get the job why did you have me sit and wait here for no reason?” They look back at him and say “you speak French? You are hired”. One of my favorites!I was riding the metro in Montreal and my car was pretty quiet except for a family presumably on vacation from the States. They were having a very loud conversation (in English) about how they were a bit lost. The wife was demanding that the husband ask someone on the train for help but he was refusing because he only knew a couple French words and no one would understand him.

Little did they know that probably a third of Montrealers are Anglophone or Allophone and that most of the Francophones on the metro that day would have at least understood a simple request for directions. 

Finally the husband walks over to someone on the car to asks for help. Before he can get two words out, the person, who would have heard their entire previous conversation, responded in perfect English: "The next stop is the one you want ... " The whole car snickered a little bit as the realization washed over the family that maybe people in Montreal speak a bit more English than they realized.My dads best friend came over and started speaking to my dad in hebrew about some great weed he just got and that he brought my dad some edibles. He assumed i would not understand because he has never seen me speak hebrew or respond to anyone who spoke it to me. While he is saying all this my dad is looking at me pretty nervously. I just started laughing because who cares. My dad is old and i know he smokes. After i started laughing my dads friend shut up and was pretty akward. It was pretty funny for me. I never speak hebrew even if someone speaks it to me because most people understand english but i understand it perfectly. Really handy to be a fly on the wall when we travel to israel. 10/10 would not speak again. Years ago, the placement of my bedroom was such that I could often hear my next door neighbors chatting as they walked from their car to their front door.  The volume seemed to indicate that they intended for me to hear, but assumed, rightfully, that I couldn't understand their language - I couldn't even figure out what language they were speaking, let alone what they were saying. However, one night, my partner (now husband) was over and he COULD identify the language.  Because he spoke it. They were calling my roommates and me alcoholic whores.I'm asian, but grew up in Australia so i've known english since the begining of my life. sometimes, I'll be walking and people will either say something to me in the slow tone of voice, or talk about me and not realise that I know english. Once I start talking they will have a double take and revert to their normal speaking tone, or they will shut up about me and walk away all embarased that I understood everything they said. the common thing is they will be surprised at my Aussie accentTwo fairly new coworkers were talking in creole to each other. It was a bit upsetting for other coworkers who didn't understand.

Some day they were talking shit about our company in creole. I ain't no snitch so I haven't told anyone but I went and greet them in creole. They were like oh shit you understand us?

No biggie, they had their reasons to talk shit but it was funny to see their reaction.Not me, but my step mother. She grew up in Japan and speaks fluent Japanese. She looks Italian and white. She has an olive skin tone, and since she is only a quarter Japanese, she doesn't look like she is from any east asain speaking country. 

One day her and some friends went to get their nails (both hands and feet) done at a salon for some "girl time". The lady's who were doing the work were speaking fluent Japanese and were mostly gossiping about men and other things until they got to the feet part of said procedure. 

My step mother's friend is a little over weight, and she doesn't have runway model style of feet. Well, the ladies who work at the salon are just starting to make fun of her in Japanese. Laughing and giggling; enjoying themselves in someone's else's misfortune and looks. 

My step mother said she let this go on for too long. It was about 5 minutes of them talking shit before my step mother replied In Japanese. Her comment to them:

"I didn't realize that we needed to look like princesses to get service here". (Something along those lines). 

The ladies stopped, and looked at my step mother with extreme guilt. They apologized in english and were silent the remainder of the time my step mother and her friends were there.I'm a Mexican who speaks Hebrew fluently. 

I was actually in the US in a deli around the time when the World Cup was going on in 2014. I was wearing a National team jersey and had been watching with family. We usually paint the colors of our flag on our cheeks (tradition). The game was over and we were getting food. 

So my parents, brother and I walk into a booth. We sit and the people behind us (three middle aged women) start speaking in Hebrew saying: "look at these stupid Mexicans (which should have been a giveaway since the word for Mexicans in Hebrew is "mexicanim") being loud and thinking they own the place. Typical". 

Well, I turn around look at them and answer in Hebrew: "yes we are very proud of our country and the great job they are doing at the World Cup. If it bothers you, you can move". 

The look on their faces was priceless. I've never felt so empowered...until Mexico did a shit job and got eliminated from the cup. 

Edit: "on our cheeks" "these stupid"

Also I know que no era penal ok?? Was walking to class with my girlfriend when we ran into the janitor who also happened to work with my girlfriend at Home Depot. They greeted each other in Spanish and then the janitor asked in Spanish “ is he the same one or the other one?” She looked at me knowing I knew what she said and tried to laugh it off 

Edit: follow up

As that happened we both walked into an elevator together because we were heading to Spanish class together. When we got in the elevator I got pissed and questioned her. She seemed to be just as surprised as I was about the whole situation and claims she didn’t know why she would say that. No, I didn’t break up with her and we’ve been dating for over a year now. I assume it’s because a couple weeks prior, we ran into this same janitor who had seen me with my girlfriend for the first and said something about I was cute. Couple weeks later with a beard and haircut she probably forgot what I looked like so I blamed it on that. Nevertheless, was wary about the whole thing and she has even questioned why I never thought more it. Gut feeling I guess Me and my friend were sharing a cab with two girls we didn't know. Just decided to share a taxi with them, because it was a long way and we wanted to save some money. They started speaking Swedish not knowing my friend is also Finnish Swede (her mother language is Swedish, she has been in Swedish school, but is Finn and speaks Finnish fluently). I understand Swedish but I was too drunk to care. Suddenly she texts me:

"They are planning to leave us with the bill."

I texted that we should tell the driver so my friend just said:

"These girls will pay half of this, before they leave."

He got the hint and didn't open the doors before they paid.

Also another time I was in an airport with my aunt. She had broken her leg so she was in a wheel chair, but because we were going to a beach holiday, we decided not to cancel it. Now my aunt has lived in Germany and speaks it fluently, I've lived there too so I understand it well, but I'm not fluent. We speak Finnish, something just to pass the time when flight attendant asks us to go on the plain first. This middle aged man turns to her wife and says in German:

"I don't think disabled people should be allowed on planes."

My aunt, who is a true badass, asks me to stop, I was pushing her wheelchair, turns to the man and says in perfect German:

"I'm sorry sir, but I broke my leg and didn't want to cancel my holiday plans. You are being incredibly offensive towards handicapped people and I feel sorry for your wife. Have a nice flight."

He turned red, couldn't even say anything to us and just looked away. His wife looked mortified. 

I have more stories if someone is interestedOddly enough, it was at a wrestling convention. I was meeting a lucha libre wrestler by the name of Sexy Star (Lucha Underground). I introduce myself to her, tell her it's so nice to meet her, and I point to the 8x10 I'd like her to sign.

She asks me for my name and I say it. She asks me again and I say it again, this time in a Spanish accent (I am Puerto Rican). She turns to another wrestler, Taya, and says in Spanish "This asshole doesn't think I speak English and is trying to mock me." I told her, "I understand Spanish -- and every word you said. I did not mean to mock you, I simply thought it might help if you heard my name with a Spanish accent." She got really red, signed the 8x10, took a photo with me, and that was that.I was at a Puerto Rican restaurant with 3 of my friends getting food. I was explaining to my friends how it all worked, because they're all American and have never been exposed to this kind of food before. 

As I'm explaining, it seems the two ladies behind us in line are laughing at us, saying oh look at the "gringas" which is a Hispanic term for white girl basically, and just making fun of the fact that no Spanish is being spoken in this Hispanic restaurant. 

As soon as I reach the counter to order, I bust out in my Spanish, it is my native language after all, and I purposefully look back at them and smile. The shock was everything I wanted it to be and more. In a shop, two gentlemen talking about me rather rudely in Arabic. 
As I was leaving, I stopped in front of them, and asked them casually in their own language “if their mothers were here, would theyapprove of their behavior, or if their mothers were just whores that smoked crack and didn’t care to have men such as themselves as sons.”

My best friends mother taught me some very colourful Arabic. I guess they didn’t think the pale white girl speaking in English to the shop keep knew what they were saying. I speak a beginners amount of French from taking it in university. When I was in Paris with my boyfriend, we were sitting at a restaurant called "L'as du Falafel" (SO GOOD). Like many European restaurants, the tables are in close quarters.

My boyfriend and I are chatting away in English, and when our food arrived we began taking pictures to send to his mom, because it is freaking delicious and the most beautiful plate I have ever laid eyes on. 

Two older French ladies sitting next to us started side eyeing us as we did this. Though I couldn't fully understand them because only beginner French, they were laughing and clearly talking about us kids and our phones, 'Ils sont ridicules!'

While I don't know exactly what they were saying and wasn't offended at all I still thought it would be funny if they THOUGHT I could understand. So at the next chance in our conversation, I said something in French to my boyfriend. I can't remember exactly what it was, very simple stuff, but in the past tense (which is basically as far as my education took me) to take them aback. It worked, they stopped talking instantly and looked a little shocked. 

tl;dr was eating delicious falafel and two ladies were talking about us. Said my Most Advanced French Words™ and they stopped their talking I teach English (to adults) as a summer job and this happens quite a lot to me.  Most of my colleagues are monolingual and as a pale ginger guy nobody expects me to speak Spanish.

Most of the time it's pretty boring stuff, but occasionally there's some juicy gossip - a worrying number of them seem completely fine with cheating on their partners back home.  Sometimes I'll hear a story or joke from one of the students and then use it in an example or an exercise later in the week, which always confuses them.

I tend to be roughly the same age as most of my students (I'm 22) and despite being an average looking man, a lot of them seem to find me attractive.  Guess it's the whole teacher thing or maybe gingers are exotic to them, don't really know.  Anyway, on my last day of work at one school, this Spanish girl (she was 21) was talking about me to her friend on the phone while I was setting up the lesson.  She was going into quite some detail about what she wanted to do with me, assuming that I would't understand.  I carried on with what I was doing without reacting, waited for her to hang up and said, in Spanish, "come and find me after class and we can arrange something". I once called someone an idiot in Klingon, I didn't think they would speak Klingon since it's a fictional language. Awkward Best instance was with two girls at a train stop, one of them called me "cute." No one would ever mistake me for being Japanese, but I studied it in college.

I was at a hotel bar in NY and a Russian couple were sitting a few chars down from me talking about what they should do for the evening. So I suggested that they go to Rockefeller center to see the tree (it was a couple days before Christmas) and try and find some carolers/christmas music performances to listen to.  

They were shocked an American could speak Russian and they were super pleasant people. They bought me a drink and talked about their impressions of NY for 20 minutes or so before they went out for the night. I was able to give them some advice and they gave me an ego boost by complementing my Russian. Uplifting one.  I'm white and I was at a bar in Beijing dancing with a couple white friends, when I overhear a girl telling her friends I'm cute and deciding whether to say hi to me. 

The thing about being white in Beijing is that you stand out in any bar you're in.  Don't even have to be attractive. 

I know Chinese from study and exchange so after like 10 minutes of on and off dancing near the group, I leaned in and said "I think you're cute too" to the girl in Chinese. They all erupted like geese orgasming and I got laid that night. Being Canadian I speak English and French.  Years ago I was posted to Germany with the Canadian military.  My friend came to visit me and we booked a trip through a German travel agency to France.  So we got onto a bus full of Germans and off we went.  When we arrived at the hotel in France we were all lined up to check in.  My friend and I were near the end of the line.  

As the line slowly progressed the two French hotel staff members who were checking us in and speaking German to the tourists started speaking in a lower voice to one another - and they were bad mouthing all of us tourists in French.  I could hear speaking and understood every word.  They were saying things about how Germans only drink beer and eat sausages and do not appreciate fine French food and wine or culture.  How Germans are loud and other non-complementary things.  My friend and I were smiling at each other listening to all of this.

When we got to the front of the line they asked, in German, for our passports.  We handed them our Canadian passports and I asked them, in French, if they could recommend a good French restaurant that had a nice wine list.  Oh, and could they also recommend a  museum nearby.  They looked at us, the girl turned red, and then mumbled something about a restaurant around the corner and a museum a few streets over.  I thanked them in French, took our key and left them standing there looking flustered. Not me but my friend's mom:

She was visiting Japan with a friend, she (white but speaks fluent Japanese) and her friend (Japanese descent but only speaks english) were on a train and some yakusa approached the Japanese looking friend and said something along the lines of, “stop speaking English, you're in Japan! If you're in Japan you speak Japanese! Your immigrant friend doesn't belong here!" (in Japanese obv.)

Well my friends mom has all the guts in the world and stood up and just started going off on the guy in fluent Japanese and the guy is just standing there flabbergasted.

Wish I was there.

Edit: word. Also, paging /u/haffajappa to tell us about her momI was at a barbershop, while I was receiving what seemed like the longest hair massage ever. two teenage girls (barbers) were complimenting my eyes and being all shy about it. At one point one of em said: "ask him out". To which the other girl said "nooooo I'm scared and my dad will kill me cause he's not from our country"

All this time I was just trying to keep a straight face and act like I couldn't understand, was really interested in how it would play out. More compliments followed. 

In the end the girl didn't ask me out but was very friendly when she told me how much I had to pay. I thanked her perfectly accenteless in Turkish. 

She asked me "are you Turkish?????" 

I said "yep" in turkish again. 

Both the girls ran to the back screaming after which angry big mustache typical old turkish guy walked out and said: 17 euro please in the most angry way possible. 
I speak fluent German and travelling is a nightmare. No matter where I think bump into Germans complaining about shit and making really culturally condescending comments. I was in New York waiting to go up to the top of the empire state building and there were a family of Germans complaining that the aircon was too high, that it costs too much to go up there, that the wait is too long, that they hope there won't be too many Asians taking photos...... like nobody forced them to do anything. They could have left. I just don't get people like that.Two guys come into my workplace and ask my coworker to arrange something for them. They sit down near me and wait while she's doing the paperwork for them and they start discussing in Polish about how to scam us to get out of paying for the service they asked for. I understood everything and sent IM's to my coworker to let her know what was going on. We stayed one step ahead of them the whole time and they never found out why their plans failed.I’m filipino but my aunt is half white, half vietnamese. She looks white though so most people don’t know she’s fluent in vietnamese.

Anyways, we went to get our nails done for my moms wedding. One of the techs was just in a shitty mood- her actions were very aggressive and her facial expressions were unhappy. The entire time she was speaking under her breath to nobody in particular.

Anyways, she was working on my aunt when she cut open her foot. I guess at that point my aunt had enough and told her in vietnamese if she doesn’t stop talking about us, she was going to “kick her in the face”

I don’t promote violence and I highly doubt my aunt would’ve actually done this but it was really crazy/satisfying. The other nail techs began yelling at her in vietnamese and someone else took over my aunt’s pedicure.Went to a taco shop with my SO; the kind that has half the menu in Spanish, and the other half in English. Only two people there spoke English. SO is Hispanic, but doesn't speak Spanish. I'm Jewish, but I studied Spanish for 5yrs, and am quite fluent.

We order to-go, and are sitting and waiting for our food. We're right by the kitchen, so I can hear what people are saying in there. My ears perk up when I hear "gringa" (I'm the only white woman in there), so I, of course, start listening. 

At full speaking volume, I hear these two ladies talking about how a nice Mexican boy doesn't need to be dating "a skinny white bitch", and how it's embarrassing that we're together. Now, at this point, we've been waiting on our food for about 25min. I see one of the ladies walking out, so I go ask her, in Spanish, if our to-go order would be ready soon. 

If she had a tail, it would've been tucked between her legs. She very quietly said "I'll go check" while not daring to make eye contact. I've never seen someone get to sheepish. 

The kicker? They messed up our order. I went back and told them that maybe if they spent less time talking about their customers, and focused more on their order, I wouldn't have had to wait so long for my food to be wrong; all in Spanish. Petty? Maybe. Still felt good. I get enough crap about being a mixed race couple from my own family, I don't need it from strangers. I was at a fighting game tournament a few years ago hanging out with a bunch of other guys. One next to me turns to his buddy and says "who is this white dude?" in Chinese not knowing that I understood. I turned to him and said, "hey, nice to meet you" and my name. Also "I know how to speak Chinese". He pretended like he couldn't hear me but was clearly uncomfortable. A friend of mine was visiting my country for a few days from Italy. He was staying in a hostel dorm that happened to have a group of German tourists sharing it. He said anytime he was back in the dorm he would hear them laughing and making fun of him in German. 

Little did they know he speaks fluent German. 

He stayed quiet for the few days he was there and remained perfectly pleasant, speaking English to them when they had conversations but otherwise keeping to himself. On the last day as he was leaving the dorm he turned to the group to say goodbye and added "I hope you all enjoy the rest of your trip" in German to them. He said the look on their faces was priceless when they realised he'd understood everything they'd been saying about him.

EDIT: Posted a comment on a small thread, went for a walk, come back to find it's blown up, woops! I realise this sounds like the most generic story ever but I'm sure my friend isn't the only person this has ever happened to, and not really sure how I could prove it otherwise. 

EDIT 2: Spoke to my friend about it since and he said the stuff they said about him was that he must be the weirdest person on the planet because he was travelling alone, and that he must be queer because he chose to read his book instead of talk to them all night. Nice group of guys. Very regularly, while working at Gamestop, we would get the non-English speaking Hispanic parents dragged to the store by their kids wanting a new game. I would give the usual spiel in English about the "M" rated game they were buying and read their faces.
(I did it in English because I didn't want to assume they didn't speak English)
They would then look to the child and asked what I said; wherein the child would lie.
The look on their faces after I explain everything in Spanish was just great. Always made my day. I don't really have a single story about this, more like a whole 11 months of it happening on a daily basis. I lived in Madrid for a year, and spoiler alert the Madrileños are real fuckers when it comes to speaking Spanish with foreigners. This made even worse because very few of them have good English skills themselves, so I'd go in to a café, order a coffee in Spanish, and they're all like "you want...eat... coffee big?" Yes, coffee big, pal. Coffee big.My uncle has a good one. My family are originally from India/Pakistan and speak Urdu, but my mom's family moved to rural Arkansas in the late 70s. It was a really small town, like never seen brown people small, but they ended up living there for over 20 years. 

Anyway, when my uncle was in high school, they had a math teacher from Japan. One day the teacher was berating my uncle for something (in English of course) and my uncle got mad and cursed him out in Urdu. The teacher replied very calmly, in Urdu: "don't ever use that sort of language in my class again, understand?" Pretty sure my uncle's jaw hit the floor. He didn't expect a Japanese guy living in a small town in Arkansas to speak Urdu.In Costa Rica.
I am half Spanish and half American, but I don't look very Spanish. While on a mission trip with a bunch of Americans in Costa Rica, we visited a school in a rural part of the country.
The kids that were at the school with did not know that I spoke Spanish, and thought it would be a good idea to talk about all the people on the mission trip in Spanish. Eg. 'Look at the girl in the red, she is really tall. The boy over there is very quiet, he doesn't say anything. He's handsome.' When it came to me, they were talking about how my hair was quite long. 
I said thank you in English, and proceeded to say 'Cuidado con lo que decís, el español es más común de lo que creéis.' (Careful with what you say, Spanish is more common than what you think). 

The looks on those girls faces was priceless. I felt so cool.   Back in the early nineties, recently married to an Indian woman (I'm white). A couple behind us at a show starts talking about my wife in my wife's native language, and wondering if she is in fact from India. They argue back and forth for awhile saying "well if she is then how did she end up with that guy."
   My wife was laughing to herself but ultimately did not confront them.
   Later that day I was sitting waiting for my wife to return from the restroom. This couple passes me going in the direction that my wife would soon be returning from. So I follow them and as my wife gets closer with the couple between us I call out in her language "I'm ready, let's go"
   The woman spins around to look at me, smacks her boyfriend and they go walking away very quickly.I'm half Chinese, quarter English, quarter Irish, and was born and raised in London - I don't look particularly British (or indeed Chinese), but I definitely look "foreign". 

In the wake of Brexit, I happened to be on the phone to my mother (Chinese) while on the train commuting into work, so I was speaking Mandarin. While on the phone to her, I overheard some little prick grumbling about "the fucking Chinese in this country, Brexit borders immigrants Muslims Polish builders taking our jobs stealing our benefits rarararararagrgghhhh" or whatever - but the word chink came into it a couple times, too. Clearly this man had been emboldened by the vote to leave the EU and felt justified in airing his racism, feeling there were lots of like-minded others.

English very much being my first language, I turned to him and just said, "you fucking what mate?" in my clearly-from-south-London accent. At this point he immediately started to backpedal, and said I was "alright" because I was "one of us", whatever the fuck that meant.

So I got called out for being a foreigner in my own country, which is both amusing and sad.Was having lunch with a friend in McDonalds once. These two old people in the booths behind us were shittalking us in my native language. It was very strange -we were just sitting there eating but they were talking about how it was as if we were "raised on a farm." Anyway, after eavesdropping for a while I got my friend to call me, then I pretended it was my mother and faked a conversation in the language. They were pretty shaken up, they said "you speak x?" That's about it, we left then. Still a very satisfying moment.So I went to France with my friends over the summer for this school trip. One night we went to a guinguette, think of it like a restaurant with a dance floor if you don’t know what it is.  We were easily identifiable as American, especially the girls (they tell by the shoes) and these kids who were no more than 8 years old decided to make fun of us (thinking we didn’t speak French).  After calling us a few names and such, we spoke French to them, and their faces just turned to ones of pure horror!  They apologized immediately and we started conversing with them. They asked us whether we were from New York or LA as apparently those were the only cities Americans could be from! They didn’t understand at all that there was a Midwest section much less cities in Wisconsin!  When we took a picture with them, we told them to say “fromage” (French for cheese) and they got sooo confused!  It was a good night.This didn't happen to me but it happened to my multilingual cousin and is a favourite story amongst the family. Said cousin, who speaks a multitude of languages (6+ but not sure which), was visiting family in australia and they all decided to venture out for a meal. 
&nbsp;

After being seated at their table and getting their starters out of the way my cousin picked up on the table next to them making some very rude comments towards my families table in German. Considering that the cousin had worked for many years as a translator between firms for German and English business operations she politely turned towards the rude individuals and requested that they stop. Ashamed and abashed they apologized profusely and even sent over a bottle of expensive wine to the table as an apology.
&nbsp;

Following the arrival of the bottle of wine there was a brief respite where my family were able to carry on with their meal, however the party of rude individuals could not contain themselves and were very much determined to continue to make comments but this time in Spanish. Even going so far as to make comments about how British people rarely speak more than two languages. Unfortunately for them this was another language in which my cousin is fluent and the scenario played out very much in the same way for them. 
&nbsp;

You would think at this point that perhaps they had learned their lesson and would stop trying to make snarky comments about my family gathering. Especially considering the apologetic bottle of wine and verbal apology. However the routine had to play itself out for the third time, in yet another language, before they would decide to pay for their meal and go elsewhere to complain about my family in peace.One language person here but I've got a funny story. I worked with a group of Korean students when working on my degree. We worked in a catering kitchen. I used to listen to them talk all the time and would try and laugh when they laughed. They would notice and give me weird looks. One day they were building about 5000 box lunches. I was working across from them on the hot line. One of them was placing bread, next was on protein, next was lettuce, tomato and cheese. The guy who was placing the cheese ran out and went to go get more. He walked to the cheese cooler but couldn't find any cheddar. About a minute before he looked, I noticed a new hire grab the cheddar and return it to the meat cabinet. Now, they all spoke Korean at work but when he went to the one in charge I knew he was asking where the cheddar was. She walked him over to the cheese cabinet and also found that it was gone. In English I say, "Miji, the cheddar is in the far cabinet next to the roast beef" then I pretend that I'm not watching them. She walked to the meat cabinet, pulled out the cheese and yelled to me, "Do you you speak Korean?" "No" I say. "How did you know what he asked for?" "I don't know what you're talking about Miji..." After all of that they would switch to English when I was in the kitchen. I went on a class trip to France my senior year of high school. We learned about and enjoyed French art, history, and culture, of course. But being 17 year-old males, my friend Mitch and I were far more interested in the topless beaches we’d get to visit in Nice.

So, Mitch and I set ourselves up on the rocky beach one beautiful sunny day, and awaited a parade of beautiful and topless French women. At first, we were a bit disappointed — apparently, topless swimming was more popular with 80 year-old French women than we’d imagined.

Eventually, a young couple set up a towel right next to us. As we listen in to their conversion, we realize they’re both Americans, and they’re arguing. She wanted to go topless. He didn’t want her to.

“I don’t want a bunch of guys staring at your tits,” he said.

“But everyone here is French,” she argued. “I probably stand out more by NOT being topless than I would without the bikini.”

Now, I was on this trip with other kids from French class, so Mitch and I both knew enough high school level French to get around. But that day, at that moment, we engaged in the most fluent and convincing French conversation of our young lives. No wide-eyed, horny American teens here... just two sophisticated French guys enjoying the beach, uninterested in some amazingly hot American girl and whether she took off her top. We were conjugating verbs like our lives depended on it.

Eventually, the boyfriend got pissed and left, and his girlfriend went topless. Mitch and I continued to play it cool, but this really did seem like the greatest thing that had ever happened ever. We talked about cheese and going to the library and whatever else our limited French vocabulary allowed us to talk about.

Later that night, we both thanked our French teacher for the opportunity. She probably would’ve been disappointed to know what opportunity we exactly meant, but we left it vague and everyone was happy. C’est la vie!My family was in a long line for a restaurant on Martha’s Vineyard and  guy was talking to his wife in French (From Quebec).  He was gesturing at us we knew he was mad about something but not sure what.  This kid with a shaggy beard and long hair who was walking past stops and starts this rapid fire French in his face.  Then he stops and In a loud voice tells everyone in line that the guy was telling his wife we should let them go to the front because we were just peasants (or something like that) and that we should let the important people in First.   The guy calmed up and they left.  The kid just shook his hair and said “fucking Quebecer”.   

Guess the guy thought Yanks were not smart enough to speak French.   So I am Venezuelan, born and raised, Spanish is my first language. However, I learned English at a really young age so when I speak it I don't have an accent. Also, I look white. As in, my skin is more fair than most of my American friends.... somehow I am always the most pale in the room. 

Anyways, I work as a nurse and if the patient and family speak English to me, I don't assume they know Spanish and usually will just work in whatever language they are comfortable. This is Houston, there is a surprinsingly large number of people who look Hispanic and don't speak any Spanish. 

Anyways, I had a gentleman in his 30s and his family ask me to clean him up - give him a bed bath. He was completely able, just a bit weak, so I thought it was a little odd but nonetheless figured it was a good chance to change his linens and clean him up and make sure his skin was intact. 

I cleaned him down from head to toe, washed his hair, changed his sheets, put lotion on his feet, gave him new gown, compression stockings, and safety socks. There is one area I draw the line, however. If the patient is completely awake and able, I will hand them a moist cloth to clean their own private parts with... I'm not even asking them to reach around, just do the front! 

I did this with this gentleman and he looked at the cloth and set it down next to him. He picked up his cell phone, called his wife (who was right outside the room) and asked her to come in. Then he proceeds to tell her, in Spanish "Clean me up because this lazy girl doesn't want to do it". Wife cleans his private parts and then leaves me to finish everything else, which I do. 

When I let the family know I am done and they all come back in the room, I very politely tell him, in Spanish (this is the first time they are hearing me speak Spanish) "I apologize for leading you to believe I was lazy and did not want to clean you up. Just remember you're going to have to learn to do it because I'm not coming home with you when you get discharged" both patient and family were too shocked to reply. I just told them, in English, "Press the call button if you need anything else" and left.

It was a nice quiet night from them :-)

PSA: if you are healthy enough to clean your own genitals it is just weird to ask someone else to do it for you, especially a total stranger.Just the other day, my co-worker was helping two Spanish-speakers. She tried greeting them, getting them to open up, the works. They were actually insulting her in Spanish to each other and laughing about it. While my co-worker didn't understand and I'm not the most fluent, it was pretty easy to catch phrases.

Later, I went over to another co-worker to see if she heard it too (she does speak Spanish fluently) and she confirmed that they were just non-stop making fun of the person helping them.In Japan, I would very very very often hear folks talking about my white skin.

Like, I'm white as ethnicity. But paper white at that. My husband calls my skin "translucent" and I get a sun burn after 12 minutes of sun ray exposure.

Luckily, they would always marvel at that. It felt weird but not antagonizing. 

However, one day I heard people calling me a "demon". I tried to eaves drop and shifted in my seat a little. Now, I lived in a rural village in Japan were about everyone was underweight (extreme social pressure to be skinny). Turn out they called me a demon because when I moved my arms, you could see my muscles move underneath (hell yeah, just got into weightlifting a few months earlier). Here's a reverse: 

Was teaching English in China, and was waiting in line at a restaurant with my coworkers. Well, attempting to wait in line. See, in China, queuing for lines isn't really a thing. People just sort of shove forward and even old, frail elderly women won't hesitate to shove a person 2 feet taller than them out of the way to cut in line. 

So, there we are, three Westerners, in the middle of a semi well formed line, when a woman brazenly cuts in front of us. My Australian coworker friend just lets out a "wow, look at this fucking bitch." 

 The woman turns around, looks at us, turns back, and then sheepishly repeats the process and lets out an "I'm sorry." 

Turns out, she was a Chinese English teacher. Still a bitch move, though.Not me, but my girlfriend(we’re both portuguese) was in London riding the tube home from uni, it’s a long ride, and half way through a couple comes in and sits down opposite her, they start talking about normal shit in portuguese(how was your day, work, etc.).

After a while he starts describing in vivid detail what he’s going to do to her when they get home, what objects he’s gonna use and even what part of the house they’re gonna do it in. My gf keeps her cool, these people are discussing in loudish manner what they’re going to do to each other as soon as they get home.

Her stop comes, she gets up and in clear portuguese she says ”Boa sorte logo a noite”(Good luck tonight) to them. The man turns bright red and avoids eye contact instantly as the woman bursts out laughing and says:”Thank you!”.

Guess they won’t discuss their private sex life loud and clear on the tube ever again.I was with my girlfriend once at a local Asian food market here in Portland. She is blonde, tall, and not someone you would immediately expect could speak Japanese. We were looking at bags of something in an aisle and there were two young guys who worked there standing near us. Suddenly my girlfriend turned to them and said something in rapid-fire Japanese, and both of them got wide-eyed and immediately went away. I asked her what she had said, and she said I didn't really want to know. I pressed it, and she told me that they had been making remarks about her and finally one of them had said that she had a blowjob mouth. Whereupon she turned to them and said, "I could certainly handle your four inches".Reversed story: 
 On a bus with school mates in Berlin, 1973. Headed to the American golf course. Summer time, bus is filled, standing room only. Lady behind me has thick red lipstick on. Really thick. Thinking only us Americans spoke English I said," guys, look at this lady behind me, that lipstick couldn't get any thicker". Couple of the guys look and laugh. Smart ass best friend goes," you shouldn't make fun of other people:, all serious like.  Lady behind me, " that's what I think, mind your own business", in perfect English. I'm two feet small by then as EVERYONE on the bus who spoke English burst out in laughter at me. Couldn't get off that bus fast enough. A very valuable lesson learned that day.I'm a native English speaker who grew up in Belgium. We were at the train station taking a family member on a day trip to Bruges. Standing in the main hall of the station up walk these two American women wearing their giant backpacks looking like they're going to climb Everest or something. 

American1 says: "This is my favorite fucking country."

American2: "Why's that?"

American1: "Because no one here speaks English so you can say whatever the fuck you want!"

American1 then starts shouting in a giant echo chamber of concrete and marble: "FUCK, Fucking SHIT FUCK FUCK!" etc.

Now, sure, some native Belgians don't speak great English, but most have been taking English classes since first grade. Not to mention Brussels is the Capital of the EU, so most people are fluent and many people are native English speakers. And even besides that, non-English speakers in Europe tend to use English swear words in conversation even in their native tongues. Literally everyone knows the word "Fuck."

So I'm standing just a few meters from her and all I can manage to say is: "Actually most people here speak English." I was probably 8 or 9 and I genuinely just wanted to be helpful and keep them from continuing to make fools of themselves.

The look on their faces was priceless. Embrassment, disappointment, confusion, and defeat all in one.My brother was visiting USA with his orchestra.  
The mum of three girls of the orchestra came along as it was a youth orchestra, and they needed adults along. They were staying with different families every few days, kind of an exchange program.  
The mum was in the car with one of her daughters, my brother and the hosting family, complaining that the car was smelling of cat piss,  with her daughter agreeing, and talking shit about the family in german, while being totally polite and like "yeah everything is great so nice to meet you" a few monents earlier.  
At some point the mum of the American family turned around and just said "Oh, and by the way, we have lots of relatives from Germany" in german.
edit: yes.CAT piss. if your car pisses, you probably should get it checked.As a white guy living in China literally everyone assumed I couldn't understand them. There are so many incidents but one of the most positive ones was sitting on the subway and a group of old folks were talking amongst themselves about me. One of the men guessed correctly I was American and started talking about our love for peanut butter. He was explaining it was delightful and his friends should try it. I promptly pulled a reese's out of my bag, handed it to him and smirked. They all started laughing. Yes. I was born in England but now live in Wales and have been for most of my life. Being mixed race too not many people realise that I speak Welsh.
When I was working in a local grocery store a woman said to my manager in Welsh. "I'm suprised people like him are working, their kind are known for not working." So i turned around and said in Welsh again to my manager. "How embarassing would it be if she found out I spoke Welsh."
She quickly vacated the shop, my manager was in hysterics.My dad's side of the family can speak fluent Arabic. My father never had the patience or temper to teach me the language, and my mother was from Quebec and couldn't speak it herself, so I was always left out of family conversations that would switch to Arabic, as I only knew english and French.

While away at university I took classes in Arabic and can then read, write and speak intermediate Arabic. I was excited to show off my new skill to my family, but kept my mouth shut when I realized how (when my father wasn't around) my cousins, aunt's and uncles would blatantly insult my mother and I, right in front of us and they have been doing it for years. So when I finally decided to speak up, I acted as if I knew Arabic since I was a child, as if I was building up a case of all they have said throughout the years, and I saw the fear within their eyes. I do not talk to them to this day, even though they send their apologizes to this day. I've never told my mother, about the incident, but I'm sure they are treating her with more respect now. My best friend (Canadian) was on a high school student exchange in France. She’s a tall, extremely good looking blonde girl, and a bunch of the high school boys started sexually harassing her (in French) at every opportunity, thinking she spoke only English. She’s pretty chill most of the time, but doesn’t take a lot of shit. 

Now, Canadians learn French in the school system, and we also grew up close to Quebec, so she has solid French skills. At first she tried ignoring the boys, until one one them said (en Français) “Hey baby. Wanna suck my dick? It tastes really good.” Without skipping a beat she turned around, and in front of all of his friends replied, “Sorry, I don’t have a microscope to find it, but I’d *love* to know how you know what your own dick tastes like.”

They left her alone after that. Well, I'm an African-American guy in Tennessee 
 with a big afro and deep voice. That being said, I've been teaching myself Russian for the past few years. I'm not fluent yet, but I'm getting better. My boxing coach of 4 years was Russian and spoke it to me often enough. 

So, I work at a small wine and spirits store downtown in my city. Because of the location, most tourists who stay at the local Sheraton and Marriott come visit us because we are so close. Elvis week some time ago brings in people from all over so we always get tourists. These two Russian guys come in looking for not vodka. I show them the Talisker Storm and they decide to take a look around for awhile. I poured them some wine samples we had out as well and reassured them I'd help them find whatever they wanted. As they were walking around they were saying in Russian how nice the store was and how nice I was. The taller one even complimented my hair lol. They brought up the Talisker to the counter and I gave them a discount. The taller guy asked why and I responded in Russian "Because you like my hair". They both turned super red and started laughing saying I'm awesome. Then we went by the growler station and they started telling me about Russia while we drank Ghost River. Good times. Taiwan vacation. 2015.



Me and my sis just learnt Japanese so we communicated in some. Shop owner overheard us and thought we were from Japan, but we are Chinese.

He said (to his partner) in Mandarin " **Japanese again. Now we can jack up the prices** ."

So i greeted them in Chinese and boy was it fun seeing that look on his face.I have a bunch of Hispanic highschool students in my early college classes.  They chit-chat in Spanish all class long because they think I can't understand them.  I always wait till the end of the semester and I wish them goodbye in fluent Spanish.American living in Paris.  Girlfriend and I had just purchased a yellow lab puppy, probably 10 weeks old.  Painfully cute.  We are walking home from the pet store and she ducks into a grocery leaving me on the corner holding the puppy.  Group of American tourists walking by and comment, "He is just doing that to pick up girls." Um, no my girlfriend is in the store.

Many times on the metro I'd overhear Americans talking like no one else understood them.  Like actually talking about someone next to them.  Saw one girl get called out by a Parisian for shit talking her.  "Little girl, almost everyone one on this train knows what you are saying.  We speak English, just not to you." This is true, if you try and butcher French most will switch to English.

Traveling with a group to Moscow we were mistaken for French just based on how we were dressed.  For a t-shirt, shorts, and sandles type of American (not that day) that was a proud moment.This was back in my Comp Sci class in high school.

This underclassmen that I was helping out on one of the coding assignments was talking shit about me to his friend in Bangla.

His friend then says "dude what if he knows Bangla" to which he replies with "no way he does his English is too good, watch"

He proceeds to ask me if I know Bangla in Bangla to which I reply with

"Yes I was born there don't judge people like that" in perfect Bangla.

He tried to play it off by saying "oh that's so cool you're bilingual too?!"

Then didn't say anything for the rest of class. 

He dropped out of high school the next year so that's the real justice hereHere's a story of how I found out a long-time friend of mine has a thing for me.

I'm half Indonesian. I was born and lived there for quite some time before I moved to the States. I was on vacation in Jakarta this past summer, visiting family and catching up with old friends.

I went out one night with an old friend I was extremely close with. Let's call her *Y*. We pretty much went on a date. I took her to the movies, had dinner, and we spent a good amount of time at the arcades.  We linked up with our old clique afterwards. 

When I dropped her home, her mom was at the door. I got out the car to greet her and show some respect. As soon as she sees me, she says, in English, "Hello! My name is *X*, I'm *Y's* mother. Did you guys have fun?"
Afterwards she starts whispering to her daughter. I was able to hear a bit of it, and realized they were speaking in conversational Bahasa. I overheard the lines, "Ini cowok yang kamu bilang, ya? Kalian sudah pacaran?" Which translates as "Is this the boy you were talking about? Are you guys dating now?" Her daughter just blushes in embarrassment, hugs me, and says good night to me as she assumes I'm about to leave.

Before I leave, I say good night, and I just let out this line, "Terima kasih, Ibu. Selamat malam. Semoga saya dan *Y* bisa ketemu lagi minggu depan sebelom saya balik ke America." Which translates to "Thank you, ma'am. Good night! Hope your daughter and I can meet up again next week before I have to head back to the States." 

Her jaw just dropped, she was extremely surprised and realized that I understood what she was saying to her daughter; her daughter was just laughing at her. She hits me up later that night on FT saying her mom was still not over the fact that I am fluent in Bahasa. She then confesses her feelings to me.Not mine, but my grandfather's that he once told me. He's from a non English speaking country, just like me, and once visited an English speaking country, I think it was the UK.

At breakfast in the hotel, the staff member asks him if he would like some coffee. Not being fully awake yet, trying to say he's already had some, he responds "I have [native dialectal word for 'already']". It wasn't even a standard pronunciation of that word, but his local dialect. 

The staff member asks him where he's from, and it turns out that they were from the exact same large city. I loved the TL:DRMan: (In Turkish) "Bunch of fucking pricks" 

Father: (Also in Turkish) "OH HELL NO"Half my family is Chinese. Regardless, you mentioned an accent. My dad learned mandarin by tape/online video. The rest of my family hate his Chinese accent because he apparently picked up the equivalent of a hillbilly accent online.As if rice isn't the culprit to a fat ass.. (well in my case at least.)this is my favorite story so far. so perfect > He looked like a baby deer that had wandered onstage at a Beyonce concert.

That is an amazing description.> being a dick

So.. he was fat?I lived in Germany for a year in school, after spending a bunch of time studying the language. I was pretty fluent.

Hanging out with my girlfriend and one of her friends and they're chatting away in German about something and the friend stops, and asks my GF if I can understand.

I replied in German that I can, and then asked why she thought I wouldn't be able to.

They used to take a dance class from an American who had been living there for a decade and couldn't speak the language. I was a bit flabbergasted at that thought. 10 freakin' years...
As someone who is fluent in ASL, I don’t know that I could have kept a straight face. Props to that manager.I used to live in an apartment building full of Chinese grad students and their families, and every day in the elevator was like this. By the time I moved out, I knew all kinds of juicy gossip.That ending is golden.Is there something cultural about cantonese and talking about shit?

My girlfriends family often joke about it I've read before that foreigners often have trouble getting Koreans to speak with them in Korean, did you experience that at all?The cashier story made me delight laugh, love the dude that was like ‘I don’t speak english but what about chinese’ like that’s going to help!!!!I love the idea of the cashier trying to help you in Mandarin I am a white, blue-eyed scandinavian guy but I speak flueny Korean so I had a lot of situations like this.
 
It’s always fun to see them panic not knowing what to do and looking at their co-workers before I continue to order in Korean.

Usually followed by the common curteous: 우와 한국말 잘하시네요 which translates into something in the terms of ”wow you speak very good Korean”Who would be dumb enough to assume that someone in Ottawa isn’t at least somewhat bilingual? Some people lolFirst one of these that made me laugh out loud. deliciousGood for you. Thats fucking awesomeI choose to believe you're ripped, and scared the shit out of him.confirm Singapore. the 'we need people who speak chinese but really we just don't want malays and indians' is so aggravating Singapore?Ah Singaporean right? Haha fucking sucks man

An uncle of a friend is Indian but speaks fluent Mandarin (Took Chinese in school for some reason) and gets annoyed looks from employers when their job listings say "Mandarin speaker required" cause really its a guise for racism. Haha Singapore confirm Hmong have been kicked out of so many places you'd think there would be a little more sensitivity on deporting Mexicans.Long live hmong New Years.

Source: am stereotypical white male in the twin cities.This pisses me off.  Like, who fucking cares anyway?  If your celebration is cool, wouldn't you *want* to share it with people?I too am east Asian who looks Hispanic. I get shit like this all the time.You should have hit her with the “Good because I was trying to sit next to you ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)”It was a flight to fucking Brazil. How dumb is she? >That was the day I gained two Omas.

The most valuable currency in the world right there.So we're all gonna ignore the fact that his mom speaks about 15 languages? That is literally a dream of mine.

What languages does she speak, if I may ask?This made my heart smile I'm a full on white girl who studied abroad in Korea and a similar thing happened to me. Dude was standing right in front of me talking about wanting to ride the white horse. I looked straight at him and told him I speak Korean. The deer in headlights look was worth speaking up.As a white guy who lived in Korea some time and speak Korean. I had some troubles becoming friends with Korean guys because there are a lot that are like this and they would be very obnoxious about it with me.

I did meet a lot of cool people that I am friends with too so I am not saying that there aren’t cool people there.That's pro level cock blocking right there.  Bravo.Two large groups of hormone-driven teenagers, this flight is my personal nightmare.  Did they figure it out?That is a good boss. Thats pretty awesomeReminds me of that scene in Click where Adam Sandler turns on the subtitles for his meeting with the Asian businessmen.Kid cries. All is good.

Confirmed ... actual teacher.

Source: am teacher> One guy says, "Is she Russian?" There was a small but significant Russian population in the city, so, not a bad guess.
 
Harbin? If so, small world; I used to live there and speak Chinese as well. Good city to make people's heads explode because nobody expects foreigners to speak Chinese. I used to use it in shops there to get the "local" price; I'd just hang out pretending I was browsing until someone Chinese bought something similar to what I wanted. I'd listen to the price they got, then I'd grab my item and approach the vendor. Usually I wouldn't even say anything, they'd just hold up a calculator with a very inflated price as soon as they saw me walk over. Then I'd calmly ask in Mandarin why that other person had gotten a much lower price. Usually the combination of surprise and mild shame resulted in me getting the price I wanted without having to spend much time haggling.
I have a similar story about China! Unfortunately it wasn't a kindhearted interaction like yours. I was there for a flagship language program for the summer and on my first day in Beijing I was buying a fake Rolex from a street vendor. The watch was 50 yuan, ok great. I give the man a crisp 100 yuan bill. He lets me pick out the watch and as I'm getting the watch he swaps my 100 yuan bill with a counterfeit bill that has a tear on it. He told me in English that he can't take the bill because it has a tear on it and that I need to give him a different 100 yuan bill. I look at him and say "你就是傻逼。" which basically means "you're literally a dumbass." The look on his face was so satisfying!I think my favorite part is that the waitress was included in the fun because why notSame when they come to Portugal and expect everyone to speak English. Boi you should be the one trying to speak Portuguese.

Edit: actually meant to say Boi instead of Boy.Thats a long time to be sleeping!
I like this one, thank you for sharing.Something similar happened to me in Berlin. I had a few beers and went into a local pub. Got talking to the people in there in English. Everyone was friendly apart from one guy who claimed he didn't speak English. I said something funny and he was first to laugh.  That subtle comeback at the end was perfect!55555 🤣Fellow cable guy. Never fails that I get the "spanish speaking tech requested" jobs. We have no spanish speaking techs here. Can follow along in Spanish for the most part, cannot speak it so well.What is your third language?Most of the first Spanish words I learned were from my coworkers at a restaurant insulting me. Some was just in good fun, some was just them being dicks. There were a few guys from El Salvador, I think there's a good chance the dick jefe fought in the civil war there. What kind of people just straight up tell others that they are worth more?My parents emigrated to the US in the 80s, so I grew up learning both English and Hungarian. And because of my parents thick accents, I pronounce some words in their accents. For the life of me I cannot pronounce bishop in proper English because of my dad. 

I have to try my best not to say 'bee-shope'.At least Hungarians abroad have some justification for assuming that others can't understand them, unlike the people in this thread that were assuming that people couldn't understand German or French.The insurance pays the bill for minors, but not necessarily for adults. it depends on the work that's done, though.That’s pretty funny haha. Is your background Arabic? Or did you learn it on your own? What dialect were they speakingWhat is a straw purchase?What would have happened if this had happened to a clerk who didn’t understand Spanish? If the gun had been sold, and the guys caught, would it be on the employee or the scammers? I am Canadian/English and my gun store knowledge is very limited, I have questions!Swedish tourists in a Welsh charity shop?

I'm guessing you don't get to use it that often.That’s quite funny of her. This used to happen to me all the time. I'd go into a bodega with all my african american friends and the people would start talking about them, not knowing spanish was my first language.

One time we're getting breakfast and they guy says we're "mal educado". Literally meaning "bad education" but its means more like rude or misbehaving, but no one was doing anything wrong. In spanish, I just said, be careful who you talk about in front of them. No more words were exchanged.

This is one of the worse habits of people who speak another language. Even my relatives do it and I hate it. My brother said some lady called him a monkey in spanish while standing right next to them on the train. Ignorance is a disease.

 Edit: Apparently this is necessary... In some cultures monkey is an affectionate term. In this case it is not. In the dominican republic a monkey is a monkey. It does not mean cute or blonde or anything else. It means monkey. Im talking about an old dominican lady calling a black man a monkey and meaning it in a literal sense; A dominican man hearing it and understanding that is being insulted. There is no misunderstanding here.Of course it's also possible to avoid this problem by not talking badly about people.I would pay money to see thatThat's some serious dedication to the long con.Did any apologize? Did she continue teaching there?I was with an ex-bf and his family out to dinner once and the busboy was Hispanic and spoke  broken English. He mocked the guy as he walked away for his accent and my ex’s mother said to him something along the lines of “Next time you want to mock someone for struggling to speak a second language, keep in mind that they speak two languages while you speak only one. Now they may not speak two languages perfectly, but you were born here and your grammar isn’t perfect either, so are you really in a position to act like you’re superior?” That always stuck with me. Have a friend who lived in Korea for 8 years and although I don't know what his accent sounds like he can speak Korean fluently. Once he was in an elevator with a couple Korean dudes that were calling him a fat american and all this shit. When he got to his floor he turned around and said in Korean "by the way I'm a fat Canadian" as he was leaving and both the guys just went pale.

My buddy is just some white guy so they never saw it coming, it sounded beautiful.> She subtly called out the coworkers that had spent an entire year calling her a foreign pig.

THESE CUNTS OVER 'ERE THINK I CANT SPEAK KOREAN AYKids are really funny like that, my Japanese teacher told a story from her first trip in country. As she was waiting in line at the market a kid walked up and started asking her where she was from. In Japanese a person of a particular country follows the format of country-person, so someone from India would be Indo-jin.

So the kid asks in Japanese: "are you American (beikoku-jin)? German (Doitsu-jin)? A carrot (ninjin)?" And she snapped back "I am clearly not a carrot."Your comment led me to google shiske and Ivanka Trump's picture came up... The internet is weird sometimes.Your dad sounds like a gem, and this story is very sweet. I'm sorry for your loss, but I'm glad you have such good memories of him.Wow, that's a great compliment on how you have no accent at all. Unless you grew up with the language, I guess.If I had a nickle for every time I wasn't Chinese.> blood curdling scream

I want you, sir, to write my memoirs.So you speak without an accent? How did you manage that?Besides being incredibly rude, that's just sloppy on their part. Most Americans at least know what gringo means. This happens to me all of the time. I am Mexican and k live in an area that mostly Hispanic. I work in customer service so I do have to speak to people who only speak Spanish all of the time. People always mistake me for being Caucasian. 

Once they learn I speak Spanish, they asked me how I learned to speak it so well. When I tell them it's my first language, they ask if I'm Spanish. When I say no, I'm Mexican, they ask if I'm from Jalisco. When I say no, my family is from Michoacán, they ask if one of my parents are White. When I say no, they are both Mexican. They ask if I'm adopted. When I say no, they are both my biological parents, they ask me if I'm sure. 😑I'm half Mexican but you wouldn't realize it immediately. When I was serving,  some Mexican banda came into the restaurant. I spoke English with them and one of the guys  didn't realize I knew Spanish,  and mockingly asked for fresher bread in Spanish. I responded in Spanish and he was surprised. 

Your story is better. You are lying,no one can speak Danish.Not even Danes. :DI like how pleasant this one is.What country is Flemish associated with? I've never heard that language before !Lol, who are these people like, "Let's communicate in this super secret language that nobody here will understand! Spanish. In Houston, Texas."Live in Houston... My conversations with my lawn guys are him speaking Spanish and me speaking English.  We both know enough of the other's language to respond in our own.  It works out.  

Just confirming that it is pretty common around here to have one conversation in two languages!This reminds me of the scene with the Asian customers in the classic 2001 film *Suckers*. While negotiating a deal in the sales office, they pretend they can barely speak English and just keep saying “bigger discount!” Over and over, then when the salesman leaves they speak in perfect English about how good of deal they’re going to get and what not. Little do they know though that the dealership has the offices bugged and can hear everything they’re saying. I wish I could find a video of it, shit’s hilarious, especially if you’ve worked in the car business. Traveler tip.  When haggling or negotiating abroad speak to your partner in Pig Latin in case the seller knows English.I'm a Polish living in the UK since 2005, I hear the same stuff all the time.
Whenever I'm in public and I talk to someone in Polish, I hear things like "all they do is come here and they don't even bother to learn English" which is funny because when I speak English, people are surprised that I'm not actually English Ugh, people like that infuriate me. Like it's one thing in a workplace I guess, but why can't family members and friends having private conversations speak in whatever language they please? Dumb bitches.If you ever decide to do stand up comedy, this will be an amazing sketch!That's a meet cute story.And? Did she find you attractive?Would’ve probably waited to speak until after they answered personally I have so many stories with tourists on the tube. In french its usually guys making sexual comments. I usually let them know that London is the 4th/5th largest french speaking city in the world (over 1mil) and that they should assume most people around them understand. 

In russian, its middle aged women dissing my dress style (jeans and band tees). Great fun to compliment them on whatever designer clothing they're wearing in russian. I've gotten VERY passive aggressive with my responses ahah.[deleted]People are such assholes. Good for you for speaking up.I’ve heard this is pretty common in Russia. You have your locals prices and your tourists prices. Dutchie here, I speak some Russian, not a lot. I work in a bar and we recently had two Russians sitting at the bar. Sometimes you dont have to understand what is being said to know people are talking (badly) about you and other people. So when they had finished their drinks I asked them, in Russian; "Two more beers, gentlemen?" They didn't know what to say and asked for the bill.

Honestly I didnt catch what they were saying, but I just knew they were not complimenting me and my co-workers. Was fun to see them get so imberrased and my co-workers al freaked about because "I speak Russian", and now sent every russian person that comes in right to the bar... [deleted]I imagined all Canadians as having fluent English Were you?It’s the same over here in the US man. I’m a natural born citizen but people do the same shit and they always assume the name I go by isn’t my actual given name. It usually goes like this: 

“Oh John, that’s a cool name. But what’s your real name? What do your parents call you?”

“Jonathan.” 

This is just an example, not my real name. Those cuntsHow would you even know for sure if a stranger speaks Creole? Do you just assume by accent whether they do or don't? How did you slip under the radar?This one is my favorite so farI had one in Japan too, but it was a bit more bittersweet.

Heard some girls say "ohh, so sexy! And blue eyes!". So feeling prouder than ever I thought I'd sneak a glance at my admirers. 

They were middle-schoolers. Must've been like 13, and being asian they looked even younger. Wasn't as flattered after that.If you don’t mind my asking, how did you learn to speak Hebrew? Is it a family thing (are you Jewish?) or did you just want to learn the language?Lol you should thank that janitor for letting you knowIf I'm reading this right... that sucks.Looks like you need a new girl OwTell me more!>"I'm sorry sir, but I broke my leg and didn't want to cancel my holiday plans. You are being incredibly offensive towards handicapped people and I feel sorry for your wife. Have a nice flight."

Fucking rekt. This is something I can only dream of saying but can only coherently put together 4 hours later in the shower.     Are you interested in more stories?

☑ Yes

◻ NoFinland has two official languages, Finnish & Swedish.  

95% of Finns would learn Swedish at school, (unless they were very old), it would surprise me a Swede wouldn't know that they'd likely be understood..just out of curiosity, how come you can speak Arabic?>beginners amount of French

**DO YOU (FORMAL) ALSO PREFER TO EAT APPLES OF THE EARTH?**P’tah?Ahh dude now I'm thinking ways of how a goose orgasms.Hurray!  A got laid story.  So far it has just been made them feel awkward. Lost face. In public. Ouch.You missed the best part! His yakuza buddy was sitting a few seats away and just burst out laughing as the first guy just looked at mom in shock :)Ive met two types of German tourists, hippy backpackers and miserable assholes, nothing inbetween. It was on their plan. Nobody fucks with a German's schedule, not even them.I feel like I would have been tempted to reveal my German so much earlier than that. I'm weak

Edit:  and there's nothing wrong with thatI also speak fluent German and during a big rush at the restaurant I was working at, a German mum and her daughters kept talking shit about my coworkers and I and saying super nasty stuff. When I handed them their order I smiled at them sweetly and asked if they needed any sauce. They turned bright red and grabbed their things and left as fast as they could. It was immensely satisfying and my work had a good laugh about it.  
  
edit: it was a fast food restaurant so they paid first and then received their food. We would ask if customers wanted sauce (for nuggets or whatever), or anything else they might need when handing them their order.This is why I don't make fun of people in general. I know how bad it feels to be on the receiving end, and I would never want to cause someone to feel that way.Okay this was the one that legitimately surprised me.U fokin wot m8As an English speaker I would never be that bold to assume someone wouldn't understand English in a huge city such as London. Especially when most business is conducted in English. So I'm born and raised in North America and when I was in the UK for vacation people sometimes had a weird reaction when I started speaking with an "American" accent. I think most of the time they expected me to be British English accent or a Chinese accent. It definitely has thrown people off before.After 9/11 I heard my fair share of this in school. It's funny because up until that day, nobody saw me any differently- just another 4th grader who was born and raised here, whose first language was English. Then after that for a few years I'd occasionally hear some mouthbreather echo some sentiment that they had heard from their parents at home about how those "damn Ay-rabs are terrorists", followed by a strong stink-eye in my direction. 

I only got death threats a few times in middle school, followed by some of these fuckers who would jeer me with "durka durka! lol" whenever I asked them a question about homework or something in 9th grade (thanks for that, Matt and Trey).


I'm thankful that I grew up in such a diverse metro area, because from kindergarden onward, most of us were exposed to people of different heritage, and *most* knew that it didn't mean that they're any different. In HS, people were "woke" enough to know that such sentiment was nonsense. I can't imagine how much worse it would have been if I lived in the boonies somewhere.Could you have chosen a more British sentence? What a pillockYou answered a phone call while seated at the table? Were you raised on a farm or something? 

(Just kidding!)>We were conjugating verbs like our lives depended on it. 

this is hilariousFluent speaker should have tried to step in with some help! I'm sure the situation was actually more nuanced but I think it would've been satisfying if the fluent speaker had stepped in eyeballing them and said in perfect spanish "Ah. Sorry. I couldn't help but overhear all your issues. Perhaps I could be of more assistance". Watch them panic.Say, what word for Demon were they using? Just imagining someone repeadedly saying "Oni" is hilarious.I’m imagining all you said was “Adios.”, but you still walk out feeling like a badass."I wish them goodbye in fluent Spanish..."

So... you said "adios?"  "vaya con Dios?"

Farva:  I got you good you fucker!Now I want to hear* an Asian speak hillbilly English I agree. The thing that always gets me is, much like many stories about Japanese people in this thread, deaf people are almost always ecstatic to see someone sign to them. 

I used to work for a bank, and I have an intermediate grasp on ASL. After about a month of working there, I started having deaf customers exclusively come to me. We would do our business as well as chat about whatever. They were always very happy. The problem is, I had customers complain because I was "distracting" with all of my signing. My manager attempted to get me to stop using sign language because she had gotten a few complaints. I'm normally a bit of a coward, but I told her if she wanted me to stop she'd have to fire me.

My point is, people can be very rude when they don't understand something, but especially for the deaf, they don't have the option to learn a spoken language -- well, they do, but they won't hear it. Yea, definitely. Koreans prefer to speak in English to you. Whenever I'd butcher my Korean, they'd automatically switch to speaking from Korean to English to me lol

*EDIT (pretty sure that this is true of like every country though. people tend to speak in English with you if they're fluent enough in English. If you want to speak in Korean with them to practice, it doesn't hurt to ask!)It just made the whole situation soooooo much funnier. Bless his poor heart.When living in Italy, I was trying to talk to someone from Africa. They did not speak English and I did not speak French, so we spoke to one another in okay Italian. It was ridiculous. 😂Statistically it would help :-D>confirm Singapore. 

Yup,  this grammar is only heard in Singapore/Malaysia

So basically flat out racism.
Yeah, you would think so. It really bothers me how racists our elder generation is, it's like they don't even notice that they live in the US."Siri, how you you pronounce a lenny face?"Dumb enough to assume any man on a flight wants to pick up on her teenaged daughters just because he had good manners, apparently. Opa is a close second. You uh...you shouldn't exchange your Omas for goods or services. Do not spend your Omas.Give a man a fish and he'll eat for a day. Give a man an Oma, and he'll forget what hunger is.You’ll never go hungry with a few Omas in your pocket.Does Oma/Omas mean "grandmother"?German and 14 regional dialects of German"Ride the white horse" was slang for doing heroin at one time; heroin = H, which then becomes horse, etc.

Same idiom, totally different meaning.So cock-blocking has an AoE didn't know that. Not that I know of. He eventually left the auto industry, so not sure if word ever got around about him.Magnus did nothing wrong.Close, this was Qiqihar. If anything it was even more "rustic" than Harbin, people lost their minds whenever I talked to them. There were a lot of times people talked about me assuming I didn't understand, but this situation stuck with me because it was so perfectly set up.

I didn't get to do a lot of haggling because one of my Chinese friends *loved* haggling and shopping and I was happy to let her do it for me. Good times!Did you get your money back?Man, you're meant to only run one scam at a time! There's a good chance the owner and waitress were related. Like sleeping beauty, but it took a magic joke to awaken the beautyFor those that don't understand the "55555“ comment...

The Thai word for five is ห้า​ which is pronounced as "Ha" - the sound of laughter.

I think somebody is testing me... German is my mother tongue. Assholes.Say, "Smack my bitch up", then take out the t sound.They were speaking in a syrian accent, and I lived in the middle east for a pretty long time so I got the hang of it :3 Felon or someone that can't buy guns gets middleman to buy them gun.The guy buying the gun for someone else that can't is the one committing a crime. Gun stores look for this type of thing.Not often, but you'd be surprised at how many people from Sweden come through my town on the way to Pembrokeshire. And one of our local poets recently died, he'd spent years going back and forth to Sweden, so many of his friends came over for the funeral. They're married now. We did it.This is quite true in common languages. Speaking Irish does allow a person to have almost zero people around him/her understand them outside of the country. Not that I've used it to speak badly about people but it's handy to have private conversations in public.It could probably be the climax of an inspiring movie.If one isn't prepared to sacrifice for the long con, then one becomes the sacrifice.I'm not sure if any apologized, but I know she moved to a different school. Not by choice, though. It was the end of 2012 and EPIK was cutting down high school jobs, so a bunch of high school teachers were moved around.That's a good mother there.This is the best of any of these I've read so far!> ninjin

Unrelated, but this reminds me of when I first heard the word ninniku (garlic). I was at a restaurant and the chef was like 'this dish has ninniku in it, is that okay?'  
I imagined it as 人肉 and was suddenly terrified they were going to feed me human meat. Apparently OP lived in china for 10 years....well, I mean, you'd have a nickel...right?Kind of surprised, had a lot of strange reactions when people’s who had on phone or did not see me directly but that was the first time anyone actually screamed.“Screaming and running in all directions”

Anyway most horror story bad guys look like me, so I could understand I have another one.
Different city but same backwater Chinese background.

I take the long distance bus to go see a customer.

At the end of ride, the driver goes to the trunk and hand over the bagages and check that your token number is the same as the one on the bagage. 
Everyone is in front of the trunk, driver is turned toward the trunk and can’t see us.

So I am in hurry and ask the driver to take out my blue bags because I need to catch my train. The driver take it out, turns back to hand it over and...

I am in the middle both hand toward him.

He looks at me, obviously confused. 

Then he looks on my left. no one seems to be interested by the bag. 

Looks back to me, I am waving my hands like “give me, give me”

Not convinced, sure that was a Chinese who asked for that bag he bends himself to look at my right. 
Everyone look bored and waiting for their bag.

Turn back to me.

(Silence)

(More silence)

“That’s yours?”

10 years in China helpsMy dad made me cringe so hard once at a hibachi place and the chef was Hispanic and he called him gringo thinking it was an affectionate friendly moniker among hispanics. I wanted to just disappear lmao. 

Edit: did not expect this comment to blow up, at all, you guys pushed me over 100,000 imaginary worthless karma points but it's still nice to look at on the screen, so thanks! Where I live it seems like 80% of the white population speaks Spanish well enough to get around / understand someone talking smack.  And you _still_ get situations like this, where Spanish-speakers try to use it to talk smack in front of white people.I feel you, I get asked if I’m polish weekly (I’m properly English to English parents) polish people just come up to me and start chatting to me in polish and I just stand there and it goes like this:

“What”
“Naldo jksjsnslw kdjsgwvk”
“I don’t speak polish”
“You are not polish?”
“No I’m English”
#”NO WAY!”

And last week I walked into my barbers and the first thing  my Greek barber says before anything else is “hows Poland?”

Like, who even does that anyway.

Then
“I don’t know, I’m from here”
“Are you sure? I was sure you are polish”

Finishes cutting my hair
“I can’t believe you aren’t polish”

I get it. Geez. 

So I checked, and I’m not adoptedWhen I was in Hong Kong, I met a man who was Dutch. Spoke perfect English. I thought he was an American. He told me, it was 10 years of watching the show "Friends."That's funny. I once met a black girl from Mexico, that's when I realised "Mexican" is more nationality than ethnicity.

Feels offensive, to automatically think someone can't possibly be "x" because they don't look like "y".To me it's odd that people assume others can't understand Spanish. Millions of people in the US understand at least some Spanish. Edit: especially in the service industry.This one is just wholesome in a thread that I expected to be mostly embarassingBelgium. The northern part. It's similar to Dutch.

The south speaks French.

edit: Yes ok it *is* Dutch. I'm not Flemish and didn't know if saying that would be offensive.

edit 2: Make your damn minds up, I'm British. Just take an interest in other countries.The region of Belgium known as Flanders.Flemland.  It's... revolting.I’m a bartender in Edmonton, Alberta, and the amount of people who seem to think that speaking French is some amazing top secret language is staggering. Yes, I speak French. Fluently. Took all my school and uni courses in the French language. Don’t have an accent when I’m speaking English.  But I know exactly what you just said about me to your buddy.


Edited for all the pedants out there ;)The trick is to speak faster. I speak Spanish with my family at home and in public places and am well aware Spanish is a very common language so in order to throw off non native speakers we just speak faster. As an Italian, I do that with people speaking French. In English, most of the time.As a Canadian with poor French living in Ottawa (right on the boarder of Quebec) speaking to someone and getting a response in French, or getting asked a question in French but responding in English is pretty common place.I had something similar happen when I worked at Target. This couple went through my check out line, paid for a couple of sodas with a $10 bill, then started pitching a fit in Spanish. I understood just enough to know they were claiming to have paid with a $50 bill and accusing me of stealing.

The manager pulled my drawer and counted it. Drawer came up $1 short, not $40 over, so he told them to take a hike, and sent me to lunch.

I got in line in the food court to get some food, and who should happen to be in front of me? The couple, speaking perfect English, making fun of how scared I must have been and how bummed they were that their scam didn't work.

Pissed me off. I could have lost my job if my manager hadn't been such a cool guy.*human Latin can also be used. Fun (ish) related story: I work in a cinema in Ireland and this guy came in last week; ginger hair, bit of a pot belly, proper Irish accent. He turned and spoke perfect (to my untrained ear) polish to the friends he was with. I must've looked taken aback because they laughed. A lot of the Polish I worked with speak English better than the English including one chap who would get stressed over who/whom and that sort of thing. the answer was always “Bennie, you are the only person with in 20miles that cares” he used to also get really angry and say things like “why can’t I conjugate verbs correctly, your language is wrong” I was born American and am a native English speaker, but I speak Chinese well enough to hold casual conversation in it so my mom and I speak it to each other most of the time. I was at a restaurant once and was speaking Chinese to my mom and this couple at another table said something like, "People in this country should speak English."

Like how the hell does that even matter to you? It's not your business so why care? It's more common than you think. People love to eavesdrop on private conversations and judge them thoroughly. So meetLiving in London has that effect..../r/fuckthesepeopleMost countries will scam tourists one way or another. Hence the documentary Scam City.Across most of Canada, yes.

In Quebec, English can get you around in Montreal and maybe Quebec City, but if you go to the rural parts of Quebec you better at least be able to communicate in basic French.We probably drank more wine than necessary and had boys over without chaperones, so I guess we were.We believe you. Jonathan."where are you from?"   

*Iowa*   

"no, I mean *where* are you from?"   

*Iowa... America?*  

Edit: some people are still confused - what they mean is "what are you?" and the infuriating answer will always be *American*  

Edit 2: the reason I don't care to answer directly what race I am to a person asking is because it's none of their business. They themselves are the products of immigration just as much as I am but they don't think twice about what they or anyone else who's white are. I'm Korean and most people couldn't point out Korea on a map anyway. It's not about making small talk. It's about trying to put me in a box to figure out which stereotype they need to apply to interact with me. Also idiots. I would never just assume anyone anywhere would not know English. Every continent except Antarctica has at least one [English-speaking country](http://www.myenglishpages.com/site_php_files/reading-english-speaking-countries.php).fake mustache You'll never make it in Alabama politics with that attitude. You don't have to feel bad about that.  The set of "people who have ever said that I was cute and who weren't my mom" adds to "two" and one of them was a dude.  I'll take it.  Being proud someone thinks you're good looking doesn't oblige you to feel the same way about them.There is actually a decent-sized Jewish population in Mexico. I’ve come across a few Jewish Mexicans in Texas. 

Many immigrated after the Spanish Inquisition to escape persecution. They were Catholic in public, but secretly still Jewish until they could escape during the colonial era"Gracias por informarme que mi novia es una puta."Okay, here it goes!

So the same badass aunt and I were shopping in Berlin, we were visiting her oldest son, my cousin. I want to point out, she's always really polite and nice, unless you are rude to her. Then she stands her ground. We are looking trough some clothes and again speaking Finnish. We hear a really frustrated middle aged woman say to her friend:

"I can't believe how rude they are, I want to look at those clothes too, they've been at it forever. I don't have time for this."

We were at H&M! She could have looked at something else and come back after few minutes. We weren't blocking her, just looking for my size and sometimes it takes a minute. My aunt turns to her and says politely:

"Oh, go ahead then, doesn't look like you have the same size anyway. We can wait."

She took one of the shirts and just left really embarrassed. Also one when I was a substitute teacher:

Had two boys who came from Russia, they had a way of using Russian as their own secret language. They clearly talked about this one 4th grader, I didn't understand a word, but they kept looking at her and then talking to each other. They were on 3rd grade. So this girl listens for a while and I didn't get involved, because I knew she had guts. I kind of hoped she would put an end to it, because we suspected the boys said really bad things about teachers and other students. We had talked about it, but they denied it, and we don't speak Russian, so we just had to believe them and explain our school language is Finnish. The girl later told me she said to those boys:

"I'm russian and you are being really rude. You should not talk like that about other people."

I just remember how the boys stopped and ran away. I praised her when she told me, because she handled it really well. These situations are so common that I'm just wondering how often I miss them, because I can't know every language there is. Especially when me and my cousin (aunt's child) are partying in Germany, we speak Finnish of course, lot of guys comment our appearance. Usually we just let it slide, but when confronted, usually those guys just apologize and tell they didn't mean anything bad which I believe. We just do it because it's kind of funTell me more!Whats German for "L'esprit de l'escalier" ?*desire to know more intensifies*Most Finns aren't really that fluent in Swedish, even if they might have had some lessons in school. My Swedish is atrocious, but I understand it passably. If someone is speaking really fast in a dialect I probably get 5%.

So I deal with Swedes in English, as do many others. Might seem like we don't understand anything at all to the uninitiated.Best friend is Arabic, growing up in/around her household where they spoke it all the time, learn a few things.

Here you go! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2NMrqGHr5zEI assume you could've gotten that manager fired for that. IANAL, but it seems like that would go against ADA regulations. Currently learning ASL. I love it when I get a chance to sign to a deaf person, they're always ecstatic. 

I was in line at a grocery store waiting to checkout and I accidentally bumped into a deaf man and I assume his son. I signed "sorry, excuse me", he pratically jumped he was so happy.Right now I work at a Thai restaurant.  Almost all the guys in the kitchen are immigrants and don't speak much English.  However, I learned a few of them do speak conversational level Spanish since they've worked in the American food industry.  Now we speak in a unison of English, Spanish, and Mandarin.  Except the Thai guys, they like to play their loud club music and get drunk.  Gotta love em'.Lived in Malaysia for a year and I saw this happening all the time and I'm just some random white person. Also happened with house rentals where people would state preferred ethnicity of tenants.It's not a new thing at all. When George Takei was a teenager, he was trilingual - English, Japanese, and Spanish. The Japanese Americans had been released from the internment camps just a few years earlier, so they definitely knew what it was like to be oppressed. Takei got a summer job picking strawberries on a farm. Most of his fellow strawberry pickers were Hispanic, but the people in charge of handing out pay were Japanese American. He overheard them discussing in Japanese how they were cheating the strawberry pickers and he chewed them out in their own language and didn't let them get away with it.

Edit: I had not heard the news but my point still stands, oppression has been around a long time and a group experiencing oppression doesn't mean that group won't perpetrate it against others.according to text-to-speech, 'degree degree'As a guy having good manners winds up with this result a lot.

When I was in Kiel I was meeting up with some friends at a bar (all German) and I'm telling them a funny story in English, and being kind of loud since I was drunk. Some guy walks up and in German asks "who's the clown." So I introduce myself. He looked shocked. Smack my bee shope.

DAMNIT.But why bring the person that couldn't buy it *with you?*My Mum grew up in the west of Ireland 1950s and spoke Gaelic fluently. Fast forward to the US 2009ish, she is in hospital very sick and we get a call she's had some sort of "psychotic break", and was speaking gibberish. No psych break, just reverted to speaking Gaelic.It would be a pretty lame movie since i dont know any korean.Especially if she wore glasses all year and took them off during her speech and turned all beautiful and stuff.I dont really understand why she would hide the fact that she knows korean for sooo long. I hope she is in a better place now though.Mmh, still, many immigrants still have an accent after 10 years.

Or infinite nickels because every time is a time that they're not Chinese?

EDIT: Should've known that getting super technical is Reddit's favorite thing hahaWell, I mean if you just stared at him during his confusion without saying *anything* in Chinese, then this one’s kind of on you...My Japanese father had worked in a kitchen in a Japanese restaurant with a full complement of Hispanic workers for decades. He ended up learning enough Spanish and they learned enough Japanese so they could communicate through some sort of rudimentary mash-up of both languages.  Unfortunately, it was *kitchen speak*, which is probably right alongside "locker room talk" in regards to public usability. I'd have to do the embarrassed-kid-shushing-their-parent a lot when we went out to eat.> Naldo jksjsnslw kdjsgwvk

This is basically the jist of the language yeaWait what features/clothing makes you look so Polish? My stereotype would probably be- a shaved head, jogging bottoms (sweat pants in American) and a stern, pissed off look.I am not alone! I'm also English, and get mistaken for German/polish all the time. I've had shop keepers in the UK start talking to me in polish, a casual friend at uni for some reason believed I was polish for nearly two years, and I've had people ask me what my native language is, and when I respond "English" they ask what my parents native language is, also English. Even in Spain I had people trying to talk to me in German, though strangely in Germany I was mistaken for being Dutch...Similar situation with a guy I knew in my early 20's. White, blonde hair, blue eyes. Sounded like Bob Marley. He was a 2nd generation white Trinidadian. His nickname was Trini.I'm a white dude in Texas, I speak a pretty decent amount of Spanish, though my grammar is usually a bit off.   Of course I learned some from school, but, most of what I know came from working in service and high school football.  

Anyway, I worked at Sams with a guy who was half Vietnamese and half black, so he appeared very Mexican.  A guy pulled up to us in the parking lot asking my friend in Spanish for directions to our mall.  My friend was baffled, so I responded telling him how to get there. He then asked my friend if we had a Macy's, which I told him we didn't.  He thanked my friend and drove off.  It was kind of a weird experience. And a minority in the east speaks German. There's an old joke: 

"What's a Belgian kiss?

It's like a French kiss, but it's half flem..."On the other hand, a lot of people seem to overestimate the number of bilinguals in Canada, especially in the west. I was roommates with a francophone Canadian from Ottawa during my month-long internship in Calgary who assured us on the first day that most locals would understand basic French even if they weren't fluent, because of school. We tested out his theory every time we went out and the results over overwhelmingly negative.Mexican fast or Dominican fast? There's a very clear distinction hablas lento por favorWhen I speak to Italians I usually just read the hand signals. Holy shit, did you confront them in line?!?!I worked at a convenience store/restaurant about 13 years ago and I remember being told by a regular to never pit the bill given to you in the register before change is counted for that exact reason. I would always set the bill on the register and give them change. Then put the bill in the register afterwards. May not apply to you now but I think of that every time I see a cashier put my bill away first. *ancient Greek can also be used.That's because English is the only language that doesn't follow its own rules.That’s when you turn to them and say in English people in this country should mind their own damn business. And that is what I call: a meetCuteHaven't even opened this sub yet but I feel this in my *spirit*Surprisingly, quite often in Japan, especially outside of the big cities, they give discounts to foreigners for a lot of things.

We don't deserve Japan.Fun fact to add on to what you've said ...

While it has a relatively small population of maybe 35,000, the majority of people in the territory of Nunavut have Inuktitut (the main language of the Inuit people) as their first language.

I'll never understand how people think that people don't understand the language of the *country they're in* just because they're not speaking the language.

Thanks for the link.Wow, I never would have thought about who sold groceries to black folks in the south during Jim Crow. It makes so much sense that Chinese-owned grocery stores filled that niche.I was 19 at the time and not confident enough in the world to make a call like that. You're probably right, even if it's not against the law.

It was also very hypocritical of her because we had multiple people hired specifically because they spoke Spanish. ASL is a language and method of communication, just like Spanish. It shouldn't be treated any differently.I feel like telling a story.

We had a particular customer at the bank mentioned above who was blind and deaf. He was genuinely one of the nicest men I've ever met, and he taught me a lot about communication with people who are both blind and deaf. They sign normally to you, you sign into their hands, so they can feel it. He would talk about books he had read (Braille) and just generally shoot the shit. He was such a nice man; I kind of miss seeing him. 

You don't think someone will have a strong impact on you, at first. He definitely did for me. He was dealt a shit hand in life. Being blind and deaf doesn't sound like fun, but he always was good to those around him.

Sorry for dropping a story as a reply to you. I had an urge to tell someone about him, because he was the person who made me want to be a better man. He made me want to walk with an air of positivity and warmth around me, and he was just some guy withdrawing money from his account.People can talk shit all they want about the US, but shit like that will land you in a court room so fast.Dude, on the real, good manners are like a cheat code for life. It’s such an easy standard to maintain once it’s established and its invaluable because it provides a template for human interaction, which comes up a lot. [7].Downvote for timing, upvote for laugh.  **What do**.Honda execs are known to be active redditorsGermans do not expect other people to know their language. None of my experiences have been bad, but every time a German visiting the US finds out I speak German they are absolutely shocked. Looks like he was there so he could pick out the one he wanted. Not too clever.Because they assumed the clerk wouldn't speak Spanish, apparentlyI have a friend who is from an island in Connemara and speaks Irish as his first language.

I'm super impressed. Ooooor, maybe they don't just mean in their life...for example, if they are playing a game and there are several options for characters to play as, one of them being Chinese...if they chose one other than the Chinese character then bam, a nickel every time they do soThe whole exchange took like 5 seconds something like that. Took me a few seconds for me to understand exactly what was going on.

Obviously I spoke to him once I understood.OP probably only realized the reason for the confusion after it happened. I guess it's not always that OP finds himself in such a situation where he talks to someone who is not looking at him. Haha thats great. Just imagine a japanese Gordon Ramsay yelling at you in spanish.I didn't even notice that was nonsense until you pointed it out.

It is nonsense, right?Hahahaha

Went to Japan a few months ago and attended a local used camera gear bazaar. Went and asked for a camera case at a desk. Old man looks at another table behind him, found one, so I asked for the price. The old man says 2000 yen. I paid him, but then he gave me a 200 yen discount impromptu. 

Then as I was about to leave, I noticed the price tag for my case, just next to where it was sitting when old man found it. The price tag says 3000 yen.I lived in Japan for two years and the people there have the most integrity I’ve ever seen. I left my wallet at a sushi bar once and when I went back the next day, the lady there had stored in a lockbox for me. She said someone brought it up to the counter. I love Japan. Some of the nicest people I’ve ever Met. I wouldn’t say everyone is nice but I can confidently say that the majority are nice. Japan is great in many ways, aside from the crushing social pressure that is driving two generations to remain single and/or childless. Fun fact 2 there are 7 different Inuktitut dialects but the changes are mostly in spelling most of the words sound the same and the language is currently being standardised.I too will patiently wait for my Alcoholic Whore Club card to arrive in the mailbox.

Tom: my mother's uterus.

I know probably less than ten Spanish words, and still can piece together enough to chuckle.

-written by RedditUgh, yes. I have Puerto Rican family so my mother pressured me into learning Spanish in high school. Turns out I'm really good at languages. But for years I thought I just sucked at Spanish because I'd listen to my native speaking relatives and be completely unable to understand what they were saying. 

Then one summer I was staying with my aunt who was having work done on her house by a crew of largely Colombian men, and I could understand almost everything they were saying. I had frequent conversations with them because I was so excited that I actually COULD outside of a classroom setting! 

I asked my (half Puerto Rican) aunt later why that was. The secret to Puerto Rican Spanish? Don't pronounce the letter S, don't fully pronounce half your Ds, make all your terminal Rs sound like Ls, sometimes Bs sound like Vs but sometimes not, and LL sometimes sounds like "Y" but sometimes sounds like "ZH." Factor in speed, and it becomes a mush of barely distinguishable consonants to the uninitiated. He means tax evasion.

Edit: wtf? +1275? I’m reaching the population levels of Finland.

Edit2: Just from my personal experience in Finland - My fiancée is Finnish, I’m English - but whenever I’ve been in Finland I’ve met talkative Finns. I’ll be there again in two weeks ;)I sit in a small lunchroom with a dozen tradesmen in it twice a day and just occasionally everyone will stop talking and the silence gets longer and longer and more awkward by the minute. 

Someone usually breaks the silence by saying "We were just having  Finnish moment then." 

I've heard that the Finns don't get uncomfortable when in silence together like that."Antii Niemi fiinished? He's not finished, he's only 29". "No, he's Finnish. He's from Finland". "Oh, I thought he was Scottish".gReAt wEAtHer t0daY System.out.println("username checks out");Now they just walk up to politicians and say "hey uh buddy we gonna give you some green bois"

By bad at sex it doesn't necessarly mean bad at impregnation by conventional means. I take it more to mean bad at deriving and offering pleasurable experiences through sex.

   Transcript show: 'username checks out'

;)

Edit1: I adopted the version from /u/whatsgoingonh3r3, since I am sure that one works... has been 2 years since I wrote my last line of Smalltalk;) 

Edit2: For everyone new to smalltalk: In Smalltalk, everything is an object and the only way anything can happen ever is to send an message to an object. So what happens here is that we create a new instance of String ('username checks out') and send it as an argument with the message "show:" to the object "Transcript". (Note that this would be considered a class or static method in java - in Smalltalk, the class of an Object is an Object itself and can recieve messages like every other Object.)

 Hey you could make a religion out of this.The trick is to combo the two together. Get yourself a reputation as an honest person, occasionally throw in a little white lie when it doesn't matter to anyone, but have just the worst poker face. I will smile and nearly start laughing whenever I tell a lie, just so I get called on it immediately. Boom. I have a reputation for being so honest that I can't even lie right. Then, when the big lies come, you bring the straight face. People have no choice but to believe you are telling the truth, because you are an honest man, and if you were actually trying to trick them, you would be obvious. Not obvious = Not lying. I can actually relate to this.  If I don't think I can get away with it, I don't lie.  People think I'm extremely trustworthy.  I am for the most part, but I can totally straight up lie to someone if I need to and they'll most likely believe me.Someone to me: "How are you doing?"

The Imperial senate is pretty much impotent at that point in the movies though, as it has been dissolved when Leia is captured: 

>The Emperor has disbanded the Senate. You are no longer a senator. What defense will you use now, I wonder?   
- Darth Vader

If you're talking about Emperor Sheev "I am the Senate" Palpatine, he probably knows of Darth Vaders plans and wouldn't care at all.They were doing pretty good in Hoth.

Or maybe they just can't hit anything with the goddamn flashlights. Gotta bring the big guns on.The rebels were seriously dug in with excellent defensive positions on the Tantive IV.

It's only the characters guided by the force (and/or being intentionally kept alive) that are magically blaster proof.Actually, the more I'm reading up on this the more plausible their accuracy becomes. Apparently gun experts (real world) took a stab at the design of the Stormtroopers guns, and went, "They're long range weapons, they have scopes, no iron sights, and they all seem to be pretty much firing from the hip rather than USING that scope." Basically, if they groups in Star Wars were further away and if the troopers used a scope they might hit something."Hindsight is 2020 huehuhehueheuh"#superbork*jerks it slowly*best, and now deadWait, do you even drive now or is you driving also a hypothetical?Really makes a meth of things.

Because he is so good


Edit. Stole this from an OOTL thread, oc from /u/BetaXP:

The long and short of it is, he's by far the best professional player to ever play the game. In season 3 (2013) he was dominating the other pro players at the worlds tournament like it was a cakewalk. He had a rough 2014 season, but has generally been regarded as the best player in the world for four straight years now and has won three world championship titles out of the four he's played in. That feat is astonishing in itself given how drastically the game can change over time and no player has ever managed to come close to his peak performance level or consistency. 

His South Korean fans started calling him the "Unkillable Demon King" in 2013 and shortly thereafter the western fans ended up just going with "God." 

TL;DR he's the Michael Jordan of LoL.

I'll take a shot at this.  Faker doesn't make many mistakes.  Most players make a lot of mistakes so when they eventually pile up bad things happen (their character dies is the most common one).  These mistakes allow the other team to pick up small advantages that turn into bigger advantages over time (usually amassing gold leads that give them overwhelming advantage eventually).  Since faker doesn't make many mistakes he doesn't give his opponents many options to gain advantages.

The biggest way that people gain advantages on faker is usually due to very high level skilled plays.  Since he doesn't give people many openings he pretty much only dies when he gets surprised by something (seems this way to me anyways).

Teams will frequently spend a great deal of resources trying to keep faker down.  Two and three man ganks are common against faker and he somehow stays alive throughout (hence his old nickname, the unkillable demon king).  So he soaks up an enormous amount of pressure while frequently giving up very little (maybe some cs). During this time, his team has been amassing advantages elsewhere on the map or even worse for the other team fakers team is coming behind them to even things up after he's absorbed all that pressure and getting kills where they didn't get any kills.

These are just his defensive abilities.  Faker seems to be able to play a very high number of champs at an extremely high skill level which is uncommon.  He seems to know how to get the most out of the champs that he plays.  Frequently just barely eeking out kills seemingly out of nowhere because he knew exactly how much damage he had to do and knew he could do it beforehand.  He surprises people frequently because he makes plays that they wouldn't have thought of in order to use a champions kit to its fullest.  There is a famous clip from a game (last year I think?) that faker called something along "I got them" in comms like 4 seconds before he even went into the teamfight.  He used a rotation of his spells and completely decimated the opposing team turning it into a rout.  That kind of foreknowledge is ridiculous.  I'm okay at the game and I'm lucky if I respond to an opening that I see half a second earlier in a complicated teamfight.  

Tl:dr  Fakers defensive game is possibly the best in the game.  He absorbs an insane amount of pressure allowing the rest of his team to get ahead.  And if you don't pressure him he outplays the opposing teams mid and instead snowballs the game all by himself.

Edit:  I feel like I should mention that I'm actually not a faker fan.  But there is no denying that he's probably the best league player ever.  He's just been at the top of the game for too long at this point to say otherwise.  It's possible that there will never be another league player that has a better career then he does.  One of the posters in this thread compared him to Michael Jordan.  It's a pretty good comparison. He wants to be better than Messi. >Fucking *insert other gender here*

    Redo from startSometimes on rare occasions the answer is not the one you expect.I'll try! So I primarily work with clients who are extremely low functioning. Here's some things I've dealt with and experienced. Please remember that I love my clients! I don't hold any of these things against them, it's not their fault they were dealt a shitty hand in life. 

I've had clients try to stab me, throw their own feces and urine at me, punch, kick, and bite me. I have patches of nerve damage in both arms from being bitten. When I was pregnant I was pushed down a flight of stairs. I also had a client kick me with both feet in the stomach, 2 days before I went on mat leave (I was 36 weeks). I caught the kick with my hands and deflected so it barely hit my belly.

I had a client cum in his hand, sneak up behind me and slap me across the face with it. I had to walk off to take a few minutes after that one. I had a client reach between my legs and grope me, he had been sexually abused and was extremely sexually aggressive. He functioned below a 2 year old level. It was horrible. That poor kid.

You learn to take it in stride. I'm a pretty mellow woman, which helps a lot. I do have to take time for myself though. Self care is essential in this job.Chat disabled for 4 seconds. I even had one in casual constantly complaining about the team 2 days ago and rage-quitting. Okay, it was 5-0 already, but the best part was we came back to 6-3 after they were replaced by a bot. That's ballchasers for ya Watch out for Stormcloak spies.> “now children, as imperial scout once said...”

"CAN'T YOU DUMBASSES HIT *ANYTHING*??!!!!"Why is this so accurate?> I knew seven people, and obviously nobody knew me.

I can't tell if you're a spy, a ghost, or just a very busy stalker.>  I knew seven people, and obviously nobody knew me. 

This doesn't make sense to me. Added wedding pressure driving single girls to extreme lengthsCould it be age-related too? When you're an awkward teenager nobody is interested. But be an awkward adult with a decent job, you're still awkward but not quite as awkward, you managed to not get fat unlike other people your age, etc., and suddenly you're the most attractive.Everyone would go after him, because he's the world's foremost security expert.Who's to say they'll know it was him. Kinda hard to prove.Exactly, I would sacrifice feeling smart compared to other people if it meant I never ran into another dangerously stupid person ever again.  The world would be a lot different and I think better. I could play the cute lil dummy for the rest of my life for thatI didn't at first but I did after I read your comment. It worked very nicely until the last stanza. Thank you friend.I saw some compilation of his best plays but I didn't really understand what was so great about them(don't play LoL). Does he have inhuman reactions or fast decisionmaking, what is it he can do better than everyone else?I read the title, but my brain didn’t comprehend.

We are so happy with his teachers and I sincerely appreciate what you do. I just hope his sweet disposition doesn't get overridden by the frustration.Woman to woman, you are stunningly beautiful for finding the hope in that sort of thing.THANK YOUI'm greatful people like you still exist in this world. A shining example of how decent humanity is capable of being. Kudos to you.As someone who is a severely autistic abuse survivor and ought to be extremely low functioning by all medical understanding but by some miracle is able to be moderately independent with support from a superhero carer, thank you for what you do. You hear so many horror stories, and when you know intimately the pain and confusion or the hurt and betrayal that prompts certain behaviors and reactions, you understand how precious good carers really are.You might appreciate the blog SLOW KIDS AT PLAY (yes it's all in caps). It's about the misadventures of a guy who works in a special needs home for severe cases. Lots of crack babies and sexual abuse survivors, with a fascinating mix of dark humour, bleak depression and the odd moment of light in the dark. You’re like a post modern Disney princess. I love you Huh- if you had said "kids" exclusively instead of "clients" I'd swear I worked with you. Of course, they were less "special needs" and more "not quite jail yet" so some of the things I witnessed were harder to forgive. I only made it a few years before I felt like I was cracking up- there are very few that can do that every day without it getting to them.

Women seem to dig that. Because another woman works as social validation.

No woman = probably not much value in this guy = no female interest

Woman = she sees value in him so probably there is value in him = female interestIt sounds like the start to a novel though.

"I knew seven people, and obviously nobody knew me. That's just how it was in this line of work."Maybe there were just seven celebrities attending the wedding?

Still, it's weird that his girlfriend didn't know him.He meant to say nobody else besides those 7, I think. He just potato'ed it.I potatoed. Obviously those 7 people that I knew, knew me.

My gf's coworker's wedding around all her former high school and college friends. I knew my gf's coworkers, but basically nobody else.In fact, any attempts to prove it will probably backfire if you're the dumbest person alive.

"Yeah everyone is only smart because of me, I wished for it on a magic genie."

"*Sigh* There goes Crazy Ted again...is there any hope for him?"They're smart, they can figure it out.  (\^:I made the last stanza fit the Pokémon theme.His game knowledge is crazy. I've seen him kill the guy he's laning against, go top lane and kill the dude the top laner's laning against, then be back Mid by the time the first guy's back, all before 4 minutes. His gamesense is crazy, his mechanics are insane, he just KNOWS the best thing he can do to put himself in the best possible situation. It's a shame he lost worlds this year because his bot laners were pretty far from optimal, but he's still the best player to grace the game by far.

Unless he's against a Gold IV Brand.Godlike mechanics, awarness, game knowledge, everything really. There are players close to him but noone at his level.He basically doesn't make mistakes. Mechanically or in his decision making. It makes him extremely hard to kill and thus he's always a threat.Let Jesus take the wheel.Thanks this actually helps a lot. It also helps when I close my eyes so I can picture it better. I am in love with this image, thank you for the visual!This is exactly what I pictured!"It's just a prank bro"Years?Bwoah.I have had trainees do that!Not OP but I worked in a similar environment, these horrible incidents are relatively rare compared to really good ones. When a near non verbal girl did a good job and I told her so and she whispered thank you, up to that point nobody at our place had heard her speak, I had to go in the back and stop myself crying before I came back. I mean, I could probably give you an unpleasant one for most days, but there's so many more good ones.Jobs like that are really like a sieve. Most people flow through in two weeks or less. I worked a group home not nearly as high-stress as the Redditor above but all of them were mentally ill or addicts and all came from horrible homes. You're right for the job if you're the target of their anger and sadness and you can still help them because dammit, someone has to show that not everyone walks away. Most days all I did was insist they had to have a vegetable at dinner and they had to do their homework. It's not glamorous and it's not enough. But it's what I could give them that they were fucking supposed to get from their parents and didn't. Honestly most of the really really aggressive kids I've worked with have had horrible early childhoods. Early intervention is so so key. Try  to incorporate good coping mechanisms at a young age and it will make such an amazing difference as he grows up.

And I have so much respect for you. I have a 4 year old. Parenting is a hard enough job without having special needs kids!!Thank you! I try. The little changes are what keep me going. And the connections. I miss clients I no longer work with. One kid was 16, and I worked with him for 4 years. I saw him go from a scrawny 12 year old to the day he was taller than me. When I would drive in he would come meet me at the car. He was fully nonverbal, but he made click noises and would pat my hair to say hi. He always needed to smell me when I arrived. He was very sensory focussed. The day he actually sat with me and leaned his head on my shoulder felt like a victory, because he was so distant generally.You're welcome! Want my worst story?

At 12 weeks pregnant I had awful morning sickness. We had a client who was in the shower assisted by another staff. Now, this boy had been sexually assaulted by family members. So he had some unusual masturbation habits. He was fisting himself in the shower. He was told to stop by the staff, because he had no concept of safety and actually damaged his rectum.

He reacted angrily. Smashed the mirror and attempted to stab the staff. I got called for help. We had to do a floor restraint for almost 20 minutes while he calmed down. He was naked and covered in feces, cum, and soaking wet.

I threw up.You're very welcome!! I try my best. So many of my clients have experienced so much pain and they deserve to have caring people in their lives. Because even low functioning people are still people.I actually had a few on the not quite jail yet side. One kid was diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder. He was scary. Like legitimately frightening.

He would stare right at you and say horrible things. Like he told me he was going to cut me open, take my baby out, and kill it in front of me.not totally true. Am married, never gets hit on. "Who would want to employ someone who can't even get a job? That dude over there who's had 5 jobs in 2 years already would make a much better employee." 

-  probably some hiring manager. Confidence is definitely key. When I got my new mustang, all the sudden I had a lot more women interested in me. It wasn't the car. Half of them didn't even know I had it. It was just my confidence around women that changed. For me it's less about having confidence and more about not showing a lack of confidence. I still have shitty social skills and suck at talking to new people. It's just that now when I'm talking to women I'm not trying to get anything out of it, so I'm not worried about "blowing it."

Last time this happened to me for example, I left my wife to get a drink at the bar. After I ordered, a cute girl at the bar flirted with me based on my order. My response was basically me cleverly responding that I have a wife. When that same type of thing happened when I was single, I was so worried about not blowing it that I  would never think of a clever response in time, so I'd panic and say something lame.The other side of this is, when you're in a committed relationship, you aren't constantly considering girls as a partner, which leads to you being more relaxed with women which in turn means you have an easier time presenting yourself as cool and confident :)Pretty much. This stupid thing works even when you're hanging with a girl friend or sister or whatever. It's crazy.r/writingprompts 

this could be a good one! "Classic Ted."Like Leonardo Da Vinci in Futurama. Me too bro we should collab.Ayy*decadesWell someone watches F1.IcemanHaha I'm sure! The splooge slap is usually a deal-breaker You're inspirational, from someone in a wheelchair thank you very much. I'm very thankful for my mind.I have a ton of patience with mentally disabled/retarded but my disdain for human beings would quickly overpower that after only a few of the interactions you described.

Do you have any techniques to calming yourself down? Or any thought patterns that keep you on track? More good stories, please?What a sweetheart!You and your fellow workers are a blessing in rough world, thank you for bringing some compassion to this world.I'm crying. Thank you so much for the important work that you're doing. My son has Down syndrome and autism. He's non-verbal at the age of 5. If he ever ends up needing the kind of care that you provide, I hope he works with people as kind as you. Cutting onions over here.Former CO here. I don't care how tough anyone is. The smell of straight up doo-doo is going to get you every single time. No exceptions. With that being said, I bet your stories are better than mine! Keep on being awesome!Lady, you are my hero.You are really awesome! Seeing and experiencing something like that and still seing the innocent human being that got hurt by an awful person - I can't find the right words. Thank you for what you did/do!
 
And btw, with my morning sickness I would puke everytime I would pass the kitchen. No way I could have entered that room! Jesus! You really must be an amazing person to go through all that and have the attitude you have. I used to work at a treatment facility for male adolescents who were behavioral and sexual offenders. I also have a couple of scars on my arms from being bit, mostly from one poor kid that had been severely abused by his father, and had many more bite scars that he'd put on his own arms.

We didn't take in any low functioning or low IQ clients, but we would sometimes accept kids with Autism if they were high functioning enough. Right before I left, my group received a child with Aspergers. He was the cutest god damn little kid you've ever seen in your life, well mannered, well behaved mostly, talked like a little boy robot, but every day he would habitually shit his pants.

I don't think I've been through half what you have and I was totally stressed out from that job in a way that I didn't realize until I left. I don't regret working there; I feel like it prepared me to be a father to my baby girl like nothing else could. I genuinely cared about those kids and watch some of them learn to actually work through their issues, but I would never do that job again. You're an incredibly strong person to do what you do and I'm glad people like you exist.  As a police officer I've had to deal with some pretty nasty people, but you got me beat. You do a hard job many probably couldn't and wouldn't do. So kudos to you Ma'amYou deserve the Nobel Peace Prize. 

> He was fisting himself in the shower.

This kid must've had arms like an orangutan. I can barely reach around enough to do an effective wipe.Hey baby

(-_o)Not just that. A regular supply of sex does wonders for your self confidence, and the chemistry of your brain. (Sex is a natural serotonin booster, nature's anti anxiety drug)*beatboxing intensifies**centuries Spotted the Kimi Räikkönen fan. There's no coming back from that one. You have to live the rest of your days bearing that scar.A lot of them are tiny things, like the kid who had never been allowed out alone by his parents, for obvious reasons, but we had these classes where we teach them basic life skills, getting the bus, going to the shop, whatever. So this kid on his first trip to the shop, he's done accompanied trips, he's done trips where someone drives along behind him or when someone watches from the window, it's taken a few months.

So he goes, everyone waits inside and 15 minutes later in he walks, giant grin on his face, holding a mars bar above his head like a gold marathon medal. It's a tiny thing for most people, but this kid is 17 and going to the shop on his own just never seemed like an option in his life. Aww! DS kids have to be some of my favourite clients. Such sweet personalities. And you're my hero - work is one thing, parenting is another. You do this 24/7. Make sure to get rest and help for yourself.Oh my morning sickness was awful. I lost weight from throwing up 30+ times a day. But by that point I was on a huge amount of diclectin which meant I usually just dry heaved. Not that time...Haha! Well I've had situations where I've had to tell the cops to back off because I have things dealt with. I have a ton of appreciation for the backup though!I seen them first you harlotIs something wrong with your eye?*unzips*I think I would forget 95% of the dream in the first 10 minutes. Hard question. On one hand, if by some miracle I retained my current social intelligence and knowledge of how things work in the real world, I would work my ass off and not waste time in places where I know were not as good as I wanted them to.

On the other hand, making those same choices might not lead me to the people that I currently know and that have made an impact in my life. I find it hard to digest a life where I didn't meet these people. That I get to have a do-over for the past 30 years AND be in the 80's again? Where do I sign up!?I'd talk to SO MANY GIRLSConfusion, relief and then regret because if it was all a dream then the people that meant a lot to me over the years weren't real.*Relieved*I would get a better fucking haircut than I had when I was 14.I would run downstairs and hug the living hell out of my parents, who've both since died. Probably have a mental breakdown. This all being a dream means I probably wouldn’t have the whole “second chance at life.” I’d just be 14. Fuck, I’m not doing this all again I’d be so happy to not have student loans anymore

Edit: I’d also put more effort into avoiding student loans. That depends on if I get to retain the "knowledge" from the dream. If yes, I'm somewhat bilingual, much more confident, likable, funny, considerate and caring, so I'll get my life together at a young age. If not, I'll probably fuck up everything the same way all over again, but ill still be glad I woke up from this nightmare. I would scream because now i got to do that soul grinding homework again. 

Edit: Rip inboxI think I'd flip the frig out. hello everyone, i am a 14 year old currently. does anyone have any advice for me?

edit: i would like to thank you all so much for giving me advice, i did not expect this to blow up as much as it did! i do plan on going to college, and doing something in the STEM field. i have been saving money for college, and i have about $9,000 in my account so far (i have been saving since i was 10, and i have a mom who has been kind enough to help me along the way). my goal is an ivy league school, and i work incredibly hard to get good grades. let's hope it continues, haha!  also thank you u/blackfogg for the gold, you're too kind. i would like to encourage any other kids that are around my age that see this to read every reply, there is some really good advice in here. thank you all again for taking the time to comment, i have read through most of them already and will try to finish.I'd RUN to get pen and paper and *start writing stuff down!!*I'd be happy. I'd no longer be a quadriplegic, and it would give me an opportunity to try harder in school like I wish I had. Get my dad to a heart doctor :(.I would be so happy that my best friend isn't dead.So happy. I would do anything to go back to being s kid. My life is great now, but there are so many things I would’ve told my 14 yr old self not to do and how to navigate life. I’d be so glad to have my dog back :(I'd be destroyed. My wife, my home, the family we've built together, just a dream....

How would I ever grow to love anything, terrified I'd just wake up again?

EDIT: To everyone saying "Find her again" or "I'd focus on doing it over". You can't. It was just a dream. Just like you can't fly dragons or jump telephone poles in reality, you won't ever find your spouse again, they weren't real. Your kids were never real and never will be again. It was all a lie that's slipped through your fingers. 

That's what makes it so damn devastating. 14? I would probably fap. That was all I did when I was 14.Fuck yes, a DO OVER? I'd learn to respect and love myself more - emotionally and physically. I wouldn't let the words of the bullies weigh me down. I wouldn't eat my emotions. I'd join track and field because fitness keeps me sane these days. I'd put down the fucking ADD pills my parents put me on when I was 10 and learn to adapt early on (got off them last year at the age of 25 and it has been one of my biggest struggles/accomplishments). I'd embrace the fuck out of life, especially knowing how much easier it was it back then. 

Edit: I'd also start listening to the Dead, Umphreys McGee, and classic rock wayyy eariler. 14 year old me had terrible taste in music.

Edit: grammer and some wordsI'd be really sad because I'd still be living in an abusive homePart horrified - 14 years old me was awkward, it was the worst of my bullying, and well even without that teens years are bad. 

Part relieved because the number of times I wished I could go back as a teen, with less responsibilities, less dire consequences for my mistakes, and mostly I can correct some of my biggest mistakes like starting to smoke, not learning to drive young, and choosing the wrong career (and thus elective in HS, and majors in college).There was actually a case where someone was in a coma and had almost exactly that happen to them. They dreamed (or whatever you call it while in a coma) years of their life. Got married, had kids, was successful at life and then woke up. I would be devastated. I’d be sad and probably cry because I lost my SO and all friends I had after 14. Then I’d go back to school and make all the wrong choices again and pray to a higher power that it’ll lead me back to my SO.Complete and Absolute relief.  I've had nightmares less scary than my adulthood.

I would give _anything_ for a fresh roll of the dice.

Edit: It's interesting how many people flat out suggest suicide... as if that'd give me another roll.‘Oh thank god that’s not my life’

Time to fix the mistakes I made! (Assuming 14 year old me realised they were mistakes and didn’t go all angsty, write about it in my diary, and forget about it as soon as the next Worst Thing Ever happened) So, so much relief.

First thing I’d do is I’d dump my (then) boyfriend SO fast.  Life would be pretty good if I could do that before age 17 or so. "oh good, dad's still alive, let me go hug him."i would probably cry of happiness, and then defeatist 14 year old me would deny [my current living situation] was even a possibility for my future and cry of sadness again. at 14 i was attempting to end my life every so often and had a bad self harm problem. i certainly did not think life would get better after adulthood.

now as an adult i work in the mental health field and have had to talk to suicidal 14 year olds on a fairly consistent basis over the course of my career. 14 year old me never would've thought i would grow up to help people who hurt as much as I did. I was actually convinced I would die by my own hands before the age of 30. 

Nope, still here! Fuck you, suicide! ~wakes up tomorrow~

~doesnt react~

source: am 14

Edit: I meant that the future hasn’t happened yet, so I can’t react to it, not that my future is Reddit. Clearing up some confusion. Cheers!Fucking hell, I finally had a girlfriend."oh no, not again"My wife would be 9, living a miserable existance in Kansas and being molested. So, yeah, I'd have to find a way to do something about that.“Thank fucking god. Let’s see if I can get it right this time.”

I'd probably go insane, if not suicidal. Knowing I'd likely have no way of getting my SO back, knowing that any new choice I made could drastically change the course of my life, knowing that certain people could die soon, and so on. 

The SO one especially. It'd be downright heartbreaking, knowing he still exists, and yet, I most likely couldn't do anything to get him. I'd run and hug my dad. He died when I was 15I'd go chasing Nicole S. The physical developments  that girl between 14 and 18 were *incredible*.With great relief.I'd start by investing in bitcoin.I’d tell myself that finding a boyfriend isn’t the most important thing in the world! You be you Then I would wake up again to realize that I'm actually a butterfly that dreamed about being a 14 year old that dreamed about being an adult. This would be a very mixed bag for me. On one hand, I'd be relieved knowing that my future bf/best friend was still alive and would be able to maybe do something more, could make better decisions and not end up with the abusers or with a crazy history of spending 10+ years with people I never saw the faces of, could turn out a lot different and avoid the pain.

But then I'd be back in hell where my depression was taking over, trying to deal with a drugged up mom and handling my siblings on my own, going through the losses I remember all over again and possibly never meeting the people I have now and love dearly.

And if I couldn't save myself from the future, if my decisions were the same? I'd probably either kill myself or find a way to block out everything until I reached my mid 20's. I never want to go through that again.

Bonus: As a note, as someone who suffers from disassociative issues from PTSD and a history of abuse, this is a real fear for me and my partners can attest that I have to ask them from time to time if the time and place we are in is real, that I'm not just dreaming and going to wake up in the trash covered hell of abuse I spent years in, or other dark places. I genuinely struggle some days distinguishing reality from my own memories and rationalizing what is real. Total devestation. I love my life. I have an amazing wife and a truly wonderful toddler. If I woke up and they were gone, I'd want to be gone, too.Id come out the closet sooner

Edit: thanks for the gold, stranger!Probably just kill myself and nip it in the bud earlyLike every 14 year old and continue the Kleenex massacre. I would probably start crying and think it's the worst nightmare id ever had. I'd cry. Losing my wife who is the light of my life, having to come out of the closet again, having to lose my Gran again, having to live with my rapist grandfather again... I couldn't do it again. I'd probably kill myself.For everyone else whose reaction was "relief," maybe consider how you would react if you continued living the way you are now for another 5, 10, 20 years- however you imagine that happening.

Then suddenly on a Thanksgiving night, without warning, you wake up. It's you, as you are now. You're [current age]. The last years didn't happen at all. What do you do? How do you change? Instead of waking up as a 14-year old, as an experiment, try waking up as your current age. *This is your second chance,* happening right now.

I think sometimes we know a lot about ourselves that we don't confront directly, because it's uncomfortable and scary. This post is making me think about how I'm living, in new ways. Gonna do a lot of journaling before bed.

To answer the question: I would be so happy- would hug my dog, my grandma, would sit on my back porch before we moved. Would have dinner with my parents. Would think long and hard about God. I would be scared, but exhilarated, and weights would be lifted and added on my shoulders in about equal proportion. I would write *everything* down.Shoot myself or jump out of the next window.

No way i'm going through all this shit again.I would be waiting for this Google thing to be invented, so I could buy cheap and retire young.
There's a story about this on Reddit. Dude got a concussion and lived his whole life and woke up to find his wife and son weren't real.

Edit: found it. https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/30t9kd/repost_a_parallel_life_awoken_by_a_lamp/

Its a crazy fucking story.I'd be truly woke. "Do I still get depressed at 15?"I would do so many things. In no particular order I'd;

a. Immediately join the club and high school water polo team because it was my favorite sport I played and I was really good at it for someone who only played 1 year. I think if I had started earlier I would have had a chance to get a scholarship for it.

b. Ask for a tutor and actually try in math because when I was in high school I hated math because I wasn't naturally good at it like I was with history and English so I thought I wanted to get into those fields, but having grown up I realized I want to do something like my dad and be an engineer. 

c. Actually try in high school (ie take as many AP classes as possible). I graduated with a 2.9 from one of the best schools in my hometown, and we had a lot of kids go to Harvard, Stanford, Berkeley, etc. If I had gotten good grades I would have been able to go to one of those schools instead of Humboldt State my first year.

d. Ask to go back to the therapist I had when I was 10 because I dealt with a lot of mental issues in high school and contemplated suicide multiple times and going back to her was one of the best decisions I ever made. 

e. Not be such a goodie two shoes all the time. I missed out on a lot of cool stuff because I didn't want to get in trouble or make my parents angry and I regret that. Also, go to my dances regardless of what people thought of me. 

f. Take the computer science course. I learned recently that I not only love it, but I'm good at it. 

g. Know that I'm not a failure or not cut out for anything. If you want something you'll make it happen, because you aren't made for anything except to be you, everything else is up to you. That's the best piece of advice my dad gave me. 

I think my life would have turned out a lot different if I had done those things at 14, but I don't regret how my life is now. I would probably be upset that I'd have to go through puberty again.Make a twitter account leaking all the WWE results years before they happen. I wasn't 14 too long ago.That would be a blessing in disguse. 
It will also make me go into a deeper depression because it would mean i'd have my heart broken twice all over again. 

On the other hand i wouldn't make same mistakes. Although my memory would fade quickly so...well I am 14 so...... this happened this morning. No joke. Yesterday I was 14, today I am also 14. Freaky.Come out sooner. Save more so you're not so burdened by student loans. Move and find my fiance sooner. Quickly write down: Invest in Apple Inc. and Google Inc.But, maybe the people in your dream don’t exist in “real life,” so you start from scratch with the current knowledge you have now. With a whole different set of circumstances. These questions fuck me up. Lol I'm really sad that OP planted this amazing but impossible idea in my head.*checks the TV Guide for Moonlighting* But the hair, man..the hair! I found meThis would be my reaction as well. I learned that I shouldn't have been so shy as a teen. I had quite a bit to offer, but that overwhelming fear of rejection hindered me quite a bit. The worst part is I managed to ask 2 girls out in high school. One of them said yes, and the other said she couldn't that weekend but ask her again for next weekend.

I never asked. Ya but they would be idiot 14 year olds. It's funny. When you're a shy kid (like I was) you believe that girls think you talking to them is some sort of a come-on. I actively avoided talking to them for fear of them thinking I liked them. 

When you get older, you realize that girls have the same hang ups as you do and don't necessarily think you asking them a question means you want to sleep with them. welcome to salviaThe people I was friends with when I was 14 are still the people I'm friends with now, as a 30 yearold. I'd tell them all about this crazy-ass dream I just had tomorrow, when we're planning to get together for drinks.

Actually, I finished typing this and I realized that if this were a dream, I *wouldn't* be getting together with them tomorrow for drinks, since we made plans for that in my dream. Also, we may not be friends at all, once we're 30.

Holy shit.This guy is taking Roy off the grid! Man I had dreams like that before. Felt a really deep bond with this person then boop, wake up and they didn't exist. Weird. Though that wasn't that bad cause I have really good friends.

This one romantic dream though, that was soul crushing. Had been in a relationship a few years before, and I think my subconscious just took the best feelings from that and crammed it into my dream, was intoxicatingly happy during and for a few seconds after I woke up.  Snapped out of it and immediately got really depressed.I'll second that. So relievedIt'd be so great. Plenty of good times but, man, would I like to change some things...Thrilled more like.There’s the comment I was looking for. I'm in this corner with the rest of the depressed people Fucking this. My parents wouldn't have lost the house, I wouldn't have spent years getting a degree only to realize too late that I actually love jobs that are more physical and active, I would realize I loved my best friend back instead of ignoring her because it was awkward, I'd know how much better it felt to run and exercise and be able to focus on that before my health deteroriated, I would be able to change into a nicer person so much sooner and hopefully help more people. This is the nightmare scenario and I would gladly wake up.I would cry tears of joy.and Thankful.Oh my gosh. So relieved. Like Scrooge on Christmas morning, I would realize that the past 22 years had all been a horrible nightmare and I had a chance to do things right.r/blunderyearsI'd go fuck Emily.Oh Jesus the flash backs. I was super into heavy metal so I grew out really long hair. And I have blonde curly hair and everyone thought I looked like a girl and my parents never would tell me I looked like such a girl. 
I thought I looked bad ass but nope. Now I have to cringe everytime I see old pics of myself I'd do the same, I lost my father at 15 and then my mother at 21. I'd do anything to see them one more time. My dad passed away when I was 14, so I’d probably have constant anxiety as the day of his death drew closer.. I still dream that he’s here, and that he was just away for awhile and he would come back and ask me what he’d missed. I’m so sorry for your loss, I can’t imagine losing my mom as well :( I hope you had a happy Thanksgiving, and I wish you the best!I'd go visit all my family and friends I lost over the years too. I'd spend more time with them. I did well for myself over the years all said and done except for that, and letting a wonderful woman go because I was a shy idiot.It’d be nice to see my dad again. And convince him to get scans so they find the cancer earlier instead of thinking it was sinus problems. I'm so sorry for your loss. 

Lots of love your way!You won't know the future, but I bet you learned a lot of lessons and acquired experience that would be valuable if you want to attempt making a better life for yourself. I'd kill for this opportunity. 

EDIT: Saying you'd kill for something is a figure of speech guys. Yes I know it wouldn't matter in this situation and no I'm not a killer.Uh, you absolutely get a second chance at life

You just don't get to know the future.Honestly tho...! I'd probably be singled out for being more of a disgusting basement dweller/sociopath even if I tried to get my shit together. The span of time that your life is defined starting around junior year would've been hard to have control over as I knew I wouldn't have been financially able to be of any use/hang out with anyone, and damn if I wasn't the sharpest tool.Serious-fuckin-ly. I'm 42 now. I don't think I could fake the stuff that I pulled to get through my high school and college years.

I'd probably walk a lot more. My hometown doesn't seem as big as when I was 14. I'd go bother girls at other schools. Actually, I'd probably bother whatever we used to call cougars.

I'd use the free gym at school to get in shape instead of doing it because my dad wanted me to do it. I'd meditate. I'd be stuck without a car but all that free time. I'd definitely get more into playing guitar and earning money for a used car, so I could leave my hometown faster.

But yeah, good kid and all that? Can't fake it again. I'd do the few things I really cannot do now:

* Hang out with my mother's father and help him get over my being a half-breed by working on soldering with him. He died when I was 16 and I feel like I knew him better long after he was gone.
* Hang out with my father's mother and practice her meatball recipe with her. I can make her red sauce, I love making pasta in sardine sauce, and I make a decent lasagna. However I never got that chance with the bugnarole and I miss those meatballs every day.
* Hang out with my uncle Paul. I miss him so much. He would love my wife and son, but that wouldn't be germane. He lived to be 68 with six grandkids. However his last three years were a nightmare. I miss that micromanaging beast every day.
* Avoid one of my aunts. I couldn't bear to look at her, knowing what she would eventually do to my grandma and what that did to Paul.[deleted]Purchase as much bitcoin as you possibly can. Then you can pay for everyone's college. No more student loans. ...give him a minute.i mean, this question would be kinda pointless if you couldn't 'take your brain with you' to the past. i'd imagine that i would retain my adult brain and ways of thinking.. also would the knowledge from college. 

in that case, i'd convince my school admins to let me test out of high school and go straight to uni. i imagine a 14 year old who mysteriously has the knowledge of a full undergrad plus experience in the field would get some nice scholarships. i'd re-do the degree i already did in a couple of years.. and probably go for a masters degree because fuck, i'm only 18. considering i now have 2 degrees and no debt, i'd start working and making some money and investing in property by the time i'm 22. the rest is well.. who knows.. i'm set up with 

alternatively i'd just get into coding and become a tech douche.


However, the stuff you learned, you didn't actually learn, you just learned what 14 yr old you would have dreamt up for that subject. So, sure maybe you thought you learned Spanish, but when you wake up, it's actually this language that kinda sounds like Spanish but is useful to no one. You learned coding in languages that don't exist. You learned how a computer works but in a totally wrong way. You learned guitar only to find that nothing you learned about playing guitar actually produces music (or it produces some crazy new genre... interesting alternative).

As for emotional maturity, it turns out everything you thought you learned about empathy and how others respond emotionally is totally wrong, so you probably would act like a sociopath.

The more I write, the more it sounds like you suffered a brain injury."Well, not doing *that* again"

*Jumps out of window*Me on the other hand would actually do the homework, as opposed to what actual 14 year old me did (didn't). I think I'm caught up in a time loop conundrum. I would probably actually do my homework this time around lolI'll take soul-grinding homework over soul-grinding, regular work. Ugh. High school homework was awful. College was so much easierHonestly until college, it wouldn’t be bad...

14-18~ academia is ridiculously easyUsername checks the frig out guys.Frig off, Ricky!Don't smoke cigarettes, don't drink and drive, sex without birth control is for stupid people who eventually become serious teenage parents (condoms are cheap and pulling out doesn't count as birth control), it's ok to say no to things that make you uncomfortable or upset, if you're on the fence about something then try it because you'll regret the "what if" more than the failure in most cases, don't mistake abuse for love (sounds dumb but easy to do as a teenager), appreciate your family (assuming they're not abusive or anything like that), have fun, you are a worthwhile person who deserves to be loved.Thirty years from now you’re going to wish that you could have your carefree years back. Not so much that you want to be 14 or 24 again, but that you want the feeling of infinite possibilities back. 

There is not a damn thing any of us can do to make you cherish your current life with perfect clarity. Because you can’t. That’s one of the reasons it’s carefree: you aren’t yet able to see what you’re risking. 

Perhaps you feel you have a terrible life. That may be true, and in that case you may discover in decades to come that your future life is better than your past. 

But you’ll still wish you could transplant that feeling of everything being so vivid and real. It doesn’t last. 

So that’s my advice. Live your life. All the way. Dialed up to 11. Because one day you’ll wake up and realize the knob broke and won’t go above 6. And you’ll be glad you can remember what 11 was like. Everything everyone said is great and I totally agree with them. Another thing - be as friendly as possible with everyone in your school. You never know who could be a friend in the future, it's always nice to keep those doors open. Also, start listening to the Grateful Dead. Enjoy your life my dude. Take your time reading this, it's much information at once. But I think, all of it is important.

The first thing, is to learn that the world is a good place in most ways. This video, influenced me more than most people: https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen - Watch it, a hundred times.

I think the most important thing at your age is having good friends. At your age, the people you will most learn from is your peer group. I mean people who are willing to put in work for the things they want to succeed in. Who enjoy their life and the people around them. They will lift you up and you will lift them up. If you fall in love with one of them, go for it. But make sure they are descent, before hand. Use condoms. Don't hesitate to break up, if you feel like they are not treading you right. Don't marry early.

Get to know yourself and stay in line with your principles. Don't base them on religion, or other holistic worldviews. Try to make a rational, logical argument for the things you believe in - If you can't, it's usually not a thing you should stick with.

If you have a good family, spend as much time with them as you can. People die. If you feel like there are relatives around you that are giving you a hard time - Distance yourself, when you can. Don't pressure yourself to meet their expectations. Pressure will lead to frustration and stress and that's not a thing you need. At all. They are the leading causes for depression.

Then, don't get too worked up, if you have done something "wrong". It's ok, you are young by any means. Try to understand what you did, especially emotionally, and then either try to fix it or apologize. If that doesn't help, that's ok. Learn to be a responsible person and don't panic. Learning that you can deal with your own problems, is very important. If you feel like you need help, never hesitate to ask for it. Multiple times, if you need to. Hold the same standard to other people - If they try to do better, don't hold a grudge. If they don't, it's a bad sign. Don't be afraid of conflict, they are mandatory to find mutual solutions.

Another important thing to understand is that having fun is at core of learning, especially when it comes to school. It's proven that fun is mandatory for actually taking in information on a deep level. So have a good time, as much as you can. If you enjoy a subject, milk it. Be proud of it. If people think you are a apple polisher or geek - Let them think what they want. If there are things, that you do not enjoy, try to be average. You don't need to be good at everything but you'll soon realize that once you get better at things, the easier they get because they become fun. 

Then I do agree with everyone who says you should form good habits. Read as much as you can. Having the ability to absorb and understand information is one of the most important skills to have and nurturing that is key. When you wake up, just get out of bed. Then make your own bed, it will give you a reason to stand up. And brush your teeth. Run once or twice a week - Or do any other sport you might enjoy. Don't go to bed too late and don't use screens 1 hour before bedtime - Which includes your phone (I wish I had learned that , when I was younger.) Sleep is very important for the development of your brain.

Try to get a part-time job, for the money and experience. If you can, do something you enjoy. When you saved up some money, travel. Especially when your family can support you. Often, experiences are more worth than saving every last penny. That said, you should save a share of it. Not just for the validation, but so you can learn to handle money. One major advice adding to this, if you can try to learn a second language - This is extremely valuable on the job-market. The easiest way to do so, is by travelling. Alone. 

Also, don't spend money on status items. You don't need designer clothes or the new iPhone. If people offer such presents to you, ask them to get a present you actually need, or a similar present that costs less and some cash on the side.

NEVER get a credit card. In general, stay away from debt. EDIT: The other way around, at some point credit cards are fine as people added.

Don't smoke cigarettes, they are insanely addictive. If you are interested in drugs, don't do them before 18, when your brain is mostly developed. Otherwise they might fuck with your personality, especially when depression and similar conditions are common in your family. Also, I always preferred them in non-party setting.

And don't take advice from strangers. They don't know you ;) Also, most opinions are far less important then you might think.

Have a good life! Greetings from Germany,

fogg

EDIT: A man, I like to listen and look up to is Warren Buffett. He might seems a bit boring, but he has more wisdom in his old brain then most of us will ever gather in their lifetime. Really be sure about what you want to do before going to college/university (if you choose that route).  I chose too young and it was a bad choice. I wasted a lot of money, hated my program, and never wanted to go to class. I envy my friends that found things they love.Do your homework, workout, don't overthink the next step. If what you're passionate about is unconventional, try to figure out if it's a viable career for you or not. Don't feel pressured to go to university immediately.Do something seemingly normal for an adult but do it as a 14 year old. People will think you are a prodigy. The truth is that anything an adult can do, you're likely capable of already. Legit do your homework and seek help if you dont know the basics. Hit the gym and drink milk. Eat a well balanced diet. If you are shy just push yourself slowly into situations that make you uncomfortable. Stay away from drugs even if everyone is doing them. Getting a job is also super easy and will give you the motivation to do good in school. - Learn to be uncomfortable and do things you don't want to do.

- Discipline and a good work ethic is more important than talent or intelligence.

- Learn to control your emotions and responses. Take control of yourself

- Have interests and hobbies

- Be social, be fun
Ok, quick list of stuff I did that helped and stuff I wish I did better:

- Learn to socialize/empathize if you haven't already. It's much better to look dumb now than look dumb as a mostly functional adult when people expect you to know better.

- Learn to accept when you're wrong, and have the strength to swallow your pride and apologize when you are. Doesn't have to be a big deal all the time. Just a "my bad, I thought x and y" can  work for the small stuff.

- Don't be afraid to try new things, but do have the willpower to say "no" to stuff you aren't comfortable with. It can sometimes be confusing discerning the two, but I found the stuff I was hesitant about usually had "I could get in trouble" consequences attached.

- Value yourself and prioritize. Your body and your mind are your own. Care for them the best you can. Staying up all night and being a zombie at school or having a sweet tooth is cool here or there, but try not to make that kind of stuff a habit lol. If it's bs, it can wait.

- Safe sex is the best sex. That pullout stuff is for dummies. Becoming a young parent or catching an std is not something you want to roll the dice on.

- Don't brush off school. I'm not saying to go hyper study, but as a recent college grad, I can confidently say discipline pays off.

- At the same time, college isn't the end all for everyone. There are many ways to make a living out here. Some of them make more than others yeah, but it's important that you find something you enjoy doing above all else. College is just the one most people suggest.

- Make some memories. Find fun stuff to do and meet new people. You only get one shot in life, and you don't want to waste it being unhappy or alone.

- I'm totally not an expert. Just an internet stranger telling you what I learned so far :)As someone else said, if you've got a good family, **appreciate them**. We all think we have years to be with them, but we never know when someone's going to pass. We really truly don't. Especially your parents. Go out and do stuff with them, apologise when you're a little shit and tell them how much you love and appreciate them often. 

I was a right cunt when I was fourteen. In fact, I've always been a right cunt. But I spent a lot of time with my dad and made awesome memories. He died when I was seventeen and I thank God that I have those memories to cherish. Now I *try* be nice as best as possible. MORPHEUS: For the longest time, I wouldn't believe it. But then I saw the fields with my own eyes, watched them liquefy the dead so they could be fed intravenously to the living -

NEO (politely): Excuse me, please.

MORPHEUS: Yes, Neo?

NEO: I've kept quiet for as long as I could, but I feel a certain need to speak up at this point. The human body is the most inefficient source of energy you could possibly imagine. The efficiency of a power plant at converting thermal energy into electricity decreases as you run the turbines at lower temperatures. If you had any sort of food humans could eat, it would be more efficient to burn it in a furnace than feed it to humans. And now you're telling me that their food is the bodies of the dead, fed to the living? Haven't you ever heard of the laws of thermodynamics?

MORPHEUS: Where did you hear about the laws of thermodynamics, Neo?

NEO: Anyone who's made it past one science class in high school ought to know about the laws of thermodynamics!

MORPHEUS: Where did you go to high school, Neo?

(Pause.)

NEO: ...in the Matrix.

MORPHEUS: The machines tell elegant lies.

(Pause.)

NEO (in a small voice): Could I please have a real physics textbook?

MORPHEUS: There is no such thing, Neo. The universe doesn't run on math.

___________

There's no way of knowing what you dreamed in your dream world actually has any validity in the real one.You were dreaming of what life **might** be like as an adult, not the future. So you buy stock in Apple, but Apple fails as a company to the giant tech giant Microsoft. Then you decide to invest in Netflix but it barely gets off the ground and Blockbuster merges with Hollywood video and becomes a media conglomerate. 

But you're not worried because you still have your ace in the hole. You invest your life savings at 18 into bitcoin.....but it crashes to be completely worthless to the point where nobody will buy it off you for pennies. Make a plan to invent Uber the INSTANT smartphones become a thing.Dude.  You don't have enough upvotes for this. What's your story?Same here. Suicide when we were 17. I'm 31 now but I still miss him.Death didn't really feel like a real thing to me until it hit so close to home. Omg I hope you're okSame.Hey man , stay strong Exactly this.

My life is pretty great, but I wasted a lot of years on confusion/indecision.  If I only knew then...I would dread the age of 16 for this subjectMy dog would be a puppy and my grandma would be alive :( I miss them both.-InceptionWell, chances are high that you would forget 90% of it by lunch. I hear its nacho day, so theres that!Sounds like the premise of The Family Man, but he wasn't 14.[Like this guy.. :(](https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/7dpxy5/_/dpzzbs4) This.  I have few regrets. I have had rough times,  poor choices, falling outs, and falling all ins. I have sunk fortunes into stupidity, and squandered talent to spare. I've also laughed and cried and shared and received. I have loved. 

If it was indeed not a forecast and a guiding path with warnings, but instead a dream of a life balanced on a razors thin line of choices, I might just snap right there. I would make the mistakes all over again if it lead me to here, but it would be hard not to change things for fear it would break it all. What if not having that one fight that ledt you both raw and hurting some 18 years ago is actually the moment that forged the steel of your marriage's blade and you never realized it? 

Oh, god, it's terrifying to think about.  

I'd love to have a handful of redos, but not at the expense of losing it all.

Edit: laughed and fried is not a thing I hopeI completely agree. I used to love the idea of a "go back in time do over" until I started doing things I like and wasn't sure I could do over.  I even mentioned this to my wife the other day. Before are some was born, if I were to wake up and *poof* be starting my first day of high school, I could find her eventually. It might take some convincing and we wouldn't have our same first date, first kiss, etc. but we could still be together. But our son, how could I ever guarantee making him again? I couldn't. We'd have other kids, but never him. He'd be gone forever. Worse: he'd have never existed, and no one else would even know him for me to mourn with. 

Edit: it reminds me of this comic (https://i.redditmedia.com/sEUXkP29mnSrjQ3q-piFONIXJCBiZZBhk9g7-sIN-9E.png?w=320&s=c25485f7214e70c514e780ba3db904d8)The only real answer.

Most people would be devastated.Wasn't there a guy here on Reddit that went through essentially the same thing?  It's one of those famous stories here on Reddit.  Guy gets in a fight, gets knocked into a coma.  And while he's in a coma he has this dream about living a completely different life.  Growing up, meeting a woman, raising a family, only to have it all come crashing down when he wakes up and has to go through years of therapy because the family he built and loved never existed.

In other words the guy who hit him knocked him into an existential crisis.

EDIT:  Here it is https://amp.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/oc7rc/have_you_ever_felt_a_deep_personal_connection_to/c3g4ot3Ah, like in the book Replay.As it was in the beginning,

world without end. 

Amen.I had to scroll down farther than I thought to find this.Funny, I'd go to the doctor and demand to be evaluated for ADHD. Going undiagnosed for so long almost ruined my life.[deleted]Me too  :(Same. I'd feel completely helpless, angry, and trapped. Just like I did at 14.Same, but I'd feel so determined to get out.

It took me years to leave and emotionally divorce myself from the abuse, I've done the emotional work, it would be amazing to go back and have those years again and be where I am mentally and work towards getting free sooner and in a better place.Fuck, you just made me soooooo thankful to be an adult.  Here I was lamenting my life choices ... from my warm, clean, comfortable, all-mine apartment.  Whatever man, I made it out alive, and I don’t have to live in that house ever again... >less responsibilities... not learning to drive young

YESThat was a Star Trek episode, dude.I've had a few dreams with heavy emotional attachments to them. Talked about them before on here, actually... they *really* fuck you up when you wake up from them. I was stuck in a depressive rut for like a week after waking up from a vivid dream I had, and it was just a few hours of time spent with someone that I truly connected with and had a mutual feeling of love for.

Woke up, and realized that they never existed, and the few hours I spent with them would probably get warped and partially disappear in a few hours or days. It was awful, and as much as I hope I dream of her again, it would be such a horrible feeling when I wake up a third time from that.Gosh, isn't that a great feeling? A lot of people wish they could go back to their younger years, but how great is it to look at your life now and wonder how you ever got so lucky?your attitude in this post gave me hope, thank youFrom one mentally ill mental health worker to another

I'm glad you're hereGet off the internet,  go enjoy your youth. I love that that's your first thought xx Thing is, your SO might not exist in real lifeThat was weird to read, I live with one of thoseI had a similar girl in my high school. She was average at best at 13, but by the time she was 16 she was uncomfortably attractive. I don’t mean like “gosh she’s pretty”, I mean it looks like she was a busty Playboy model built exclusively for sex. She was always blonde with a pretty face and was a comfortable weight, but one day she seemed to just spontaneously become a wasp-waisted pornstar with D cups, birthing hips, and fuck-me lips. 

I say she was “uncomfortably” attractive because it honestly seemed to be too much and made things uneasy in school. Male teachers were *terrified* of being seen alone with her, and they would stare at the ground whenever she walked near them (It didn’t help that she walked around with the mannerisms of a hooker in heat). It was even a little awkward for the male students. Any guy talking to her about schoolwork was glared at with angry envy by every other guy, and every girl fumed with jealously and later took it out on the poor guy that had just been asking the fuck-princess for a spare piece of paper.

She never graduated because the exact *day* she turned 18, she dropped out of class, left her home, and became a high class escort in Vegas. We know this because several guys in our class actually took a road trip to Vegas later that year (an 18 hour drive) solely to hit her up and, uh, support her new profession. We later learned that she had been cut from the same cloth as her mom, who had been one of the most exclusive prostitutes in Vegas in the 1980s, which makes sense and explains the daughter’s over-the-top pornstar genes.

But damn, she was really something back when she was an “innocent” teenager. To this day I’ve never seen a girl with a more extreme cup-size to waist ratio, or a girl that, for better or worse, seemed to instantly make any guy think of sex. I’d honestly feel bad for her, but from all accounts she was thrilled with her body and her new job. If only I had known back before she hit puberty, and got close to her before it all began...But it’s not seeing into the future, it’s just dreaming about it. You invest all your money in bitcoin, it crashes and you’re brokeButterflies don't concern themselves with such things, StanExactly this. I would be devastated at the loss of my children. They are the greatest loves of my life. My job and home are great too, but I could get those back or something comparable. The kids are unique though. I could never again get that exact sperm to meet that exact egg to get that exact kid and so they would be lost forever.Yeah, you've got the right track. You experienced the worst of it, so it's a almost a safe rerun.

"Mom, Dad, I'm gay. However I'm a bear, so there won't be any of that swishy stuff -- you're off the hook, dad. Also, I learned that I actually liked sports now that it's a free show in the locker rooms, so I'm going out for wrestling.

"Oh, and ma? Don't worry about not getting grandkids. My sister will be knocked up in about three years."YEP. Although given how many times I realized I was gay and then was like "lol nvm," I'm concerned it wouldn't stick... Same! Me too. If I figured out I was trans at 14 (and gone on blockers, then HRT at 16) instead of nearly 20 my life would have been infinitely easier and happier. I had to scroll way too far to find this. I’m not going through all of that againAbsolutely. I'd kill myself, after talking to my now deceased grandparents one more time. At 14 I thought I'd go to college, have a career, have a normal life.  I'm ok now, I deal with with what I've got, but knowing then what I have to live through..... I'd rather not.No doubtI'd walk to the train tracks, lay down, and let a train run me over.

Hell, I don't even want to deal with this shit now as is.So what if you woke up and found you were an adult dreaming you were 14? Huh? Mind blown.School is important. I didnt realize it till after I was working some shitty job and seeing some older guys who are deadbeats working shit pay at a shit job. Hit the gym and eat a well balanced diet. just all caps: BITCOINWhy? You only *dreamed* that those were successful companies.I’d feel pretty depressed if i find out my girlfriend was only in my dreams. Fuck, this would be the worst of it. What if I woke up and my wife didn't exist? Not that I didn't have her and she was still around, but that she never existed at all, and I'd never be able to find another person like her?

No stock or Bitcoin in the world is worth that. Is this not something normal people think about multiple times a day? Oh.Oh god- at least you asked two.... I asked none. It has left me at a point in life where I have no experience in the matter and crippling fear of rejection at an age where several of my peers have kids already.This bugs me every single moment. More worrisome thing is, this shy nature horrifically grow into overthinking and unreasonable hesitations when you have to interact opposite gender. Leave asking out, something would hold you even from giving nice little compliments. There is no reason to fear. They are humans and they have feelings too but we remain in the captivity of out shitty speculations.Yeah after living this life, not sure I'd be able to be attracted to girls that young anymore. Would kinda gross me out a bit- I'm 29 for reference.That didn’t stop Roy Moore.How many countless years was I... wait, what are years? What is... "I?" Did someone play a trick on me? Uhhh... but I...I... There was a tunnel... Shit. How long was I out? Three minutes?! What do you mean you guys don't want to try this now? Wtf are we gonna do with all this salvia? What? Yeah, you should try it. I think...I think it's an important experience. Hell no I'm not gonna do this again. Yeah I'm just gonna sit here for a bit. Let me just... Collect my thoughts.BIG MONEY SALVIATo be fair when there's salvia involved all the people are lizards and kind of hard to relate toFuck. Yeah. I mean, I know that the world isn't a series of flip book-like... things... that I can accidentally transcend while inter-dimensional beings try to force me back into them... but also I now don't know that for sure. Because I 'lived' it. Yep, don't know what the rest of this thread is talking about. Those were the most carefree yewrs of my life. What is this adulting shit.Why would you call my ears blundery? :(As an Emily... do I get a say?Me too.Ban emily
"what would you do if you woke up as 14?"

"fuck a 14 year old. dur"> I looked like a girl and my parents never would tell me I looked like such a girl

To be fair, had they told you you would've just grown it longer. I mean, you were a teenager.My dad died in July. I'd do literally anything to give him one more hug. Thanksgiving was his holiday so today was really hard. I don't really know what to say, but what you wrote is powerful and I feel lucky despite being sad a lot of the time. I hope you're okay.Thankfully, I do still have both of my parents around, so I can't possibly fathom what this would be like. Despite that, the thought that one day they'll be gone absolutely terrifies me!

I'm truly sorry yours are no longer with us :(Don't mess with the timeline barryMaybe. The thing with it being a dream is that it's all going on in our head. All of our lessons are things we came up with based on our interactions with ourselves. If I learn in my dream that I need to stand up for myself more, I'm actually just learning that my subconscious thinks I need to stand up for myself more. In reality, I could be doing that plenty and standing up for myself more will just make me a jerk.But not in the sense of “I won’t do this again.” Because it’s a completely different situation Can you explain what you mean? I'm confused by your phrasingI don’t know why this resonated with me so much. Maybe because I, too, have an Uncle Paul. Or maybe because I’m drunk. Either way, happy Thanksgiving. What did your aunt do to your grandma and Uncle Paul?
Fuck im so interested right now> He died when I was 16 and I feel like I knew him better long after he was gone.

I know how this feels.  My dad passed away a year ago and feel I'm really better getting to know him now that he's gone. As well as do so great in high school that scholarships come in easy.I didn't realize just how good of an idea the accelerated track would have been. I did AP and IB and knew it was a good idea but when I got to college I forgot about accelerating my track and even took extra classes for fun. Sure I learned a lot but I also lost a lot of drive and ambition for moving towards a directed future On that note I would have dropped out of school and invested in bitcoin Post doesn't say you time travel, says you dreamed ahead, your dreams are most likely not an accurate depiction of the future Unfortunately you didn't actually travel through time, but only dreamed that bitcoin would be successful.#**SHIT**

#***THE OVEN***can anyone explain what does this mean? im not getting the joke hereDude you'd skip the fun years of life?
Though I suppose depending how old you are, hanging out with mentally 14 year olds might not appeal. It's not so bad being only 21.> Jumps out of window

At which point you wake up from a daydream, wondering why you thought jumping out of an open first story window would kill you. Or why death was preferable to *just not doing* your homework.I think I'd do even *less* homework than before: I'm pretty sure I dreamed a valid university education, plus years of technology skills.

Maybe the particular technologies were just a dream, but programming existed based on the same principles as they do today.

So probably I would use my massive amount of free time to make a ton of money, then spiral into despair about losing my previous life together with my wife, then eventually pull it together and forge a new life,Yeah but you get money thoI'll take the one that gives me financial freedom.What freaking party school did you go to?Yeah, but after 18 there's still that homework that needs to be done.Assuming I kept all my knowledge and it was accurate then homework would be an absolute walk in the park for me.Very much depends on where you go to high school. Plus the work is more likely to be tedious and in subjects you don't give a shit about. It really depends on the curriculum. Aw, frig.#FUCK OFF, RANDYAnd use sunscreen. That asshole sun catches up to you down the road. Use ear plugs at concerts because tinnitus sucks ass.Also, learn good posture.  You can't get a replacement spine.I hope my knob doesn't break.That was one of the best things I've read on Reddit. I'm a 45 year old man and boy, does that ever ring true.I don't want carefree years back. There's a richness to life when you're supporting a family. That sounded like a John Hughes movie monologue. > be as friendly as possible with everyone in your school. You never know who could be a friend in the future, it's always nice to keep those doors open.

This is so true.  I was a bit douche-y to someone in High School who has since, for some reason, added me to Facebook.  In the intervening years I've realized that the guy is pretty cool, and interested in many similar things.  

Dave, you're a cool guy.  Sorry we stopped being best friends after grade 2, and sorry I was a douche in HS.
Credit cards are actually an extremely useful thing to have if you aren't an idiot with your money>Hit the gym and drink milk

This, so much.

Hard to achieve at that age, worth nurturing I read somewhere that the original concept was that the humans were being used for their brains as processors for the machines, but it was scrapped because they thought it was too complicated for the average moviegoer to understand.Except Neo and Morpheus are just in a another level of the matrix above the one they're in originally to keep them complacentI always thought the story being that the machines were harnessing the immense computing power of the human mind would have been so much better. Still it would be a damn good story. And if you woke up as a 14 year old it would only be a matter of time before your current life would quickly push away the memories of your dreamed one.

Writing it down would help you to remember what the choices you made were, and how they affected you and who they turned you into so you can pursue them again or not.> Blockbuster merges with Hollywood video and becomes a media conglomerate.

I'm right there with ya on this one.  From about the beginning of college, i can trace basically my entire adult life and the way everything's turned out back along a flimsy strand of decisions that would normally seem like throwaways, and/or just plain mistakes.  I don't think i could recreate it all if i tried.  Sure, what i get instead could end up better, but it could easily also end up worse.I feel like people in their lower 20's (who are not married or who don't have kids) would be more or less OK with this scenario. Old people like me (upper 30's) and anyone else in a serious long term relationship, or people with kids... this scenario would destroy us. I often think that after fapping. I'm glad I'm not the only one.

Here I am, 42. I still fap like I did at 14, only a year after leaving altar boy duties. The differences are subtle: I use my left hand so I can scroll with the right one, I never have to look at the same stuff twice, I'm married. But yeah, none of the future advances nor my ascent to maturity got rid of the need to put a hula hoop on the bishop.https://amp.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/oc7rc/have_you_ever_felt_a_deep_personal_connection_to/c3g4ot3

I didn’t realize what I was remembering was a comment on reddit, so obviously that brings the validity into question. Fuck. Jealous.My wife is the one thing that would prevent me from ever changing anything. I'd be too scared that any change in my past could change my relationship with her How would you enjoy your youth at 14 besides the Internet?Nah, this is me enjoying my youth. That’s what everyone my age does.lol 16,poor and no friends... what is youthJust reading that would make me even more insane.  Every single time I see my wife I figure I'm one of the luckiest men in the world, and to think that it was all make believe would just suck.You're telling me, that's my sister's name.I briefly was married to a girl like this; she was over the top nuts and actively tried to ruin our daughters life, who I got custody of. You dodged a bullet, well maybe really the bullet wasn’t even going near you, but looks <> happiness, give me a smart, funny average girl any day vs super hot tramp.You’re 14, you’re broke anyways. No real loss.Eh, throwing $100 when it was really low isn't going to make or break you if it doesn't take off like it did... However if it takes off, $100 will surely make youMom: WAIT WHAT?!?plot twist: sister is twelveHey, also trans and I fantasize now about being able to go back in time and even just start blockers! Oh god this scenario sounds wonderful.I'm with you. Half of the time when driving to work I think how nice it would be to crash into one of the trees on the side of the highway at 90 MPH.I wonder if the value would be different if someone had bought tons and tons of bitcoin right when it started and just held on to it...“BITCOIN”?  Huh whats a bitcoin?  Stupid dream.  Off to school I go!>I’d feel pretty depressed if i find out my girlfriend was only in my dreams. 

I remembered the tale of a man who was in a coma for a period of time - while he was in this coma he dreamed dreams of a family. His family. Intimate, detailed dreams.

He knew his wife's name, everything about her. About their children. The names of his children. Then he awoke one day, to find that everything he loved and cherished *never really existed.*

He spent most of the rest of his days trying to find a way to go back to sleep. To see his family again.This would be an awesome Black Mirror episode if they did it right. My version is that it wasn't just a dream and that I can now be rich based on all the bitcoin/sport scores I can remember plus not be dumb and lose a good girlfriend. Used to before coming a dad.

Now I’d just miss my little girl.Don't forget suicidal depression and constant feelings of inadequacy, at least that's how it is for meHey, we’re the same. Kinda weird to think that many people are in this exact situation right now with no one to talk to about it.The best time to plant a tree is twenty years ago. The second best time is today.Lol /r/me_irl. Except my peers don't have kids yet and I still convince myself the problem is I don't meet anyone I'm actually interested in.

But when you're a 23 y/o male and you've never asked someone out (or even admitted you are interested in them lol)... let's be real here.I still haven't asked one. I'm 33. :D D:Lesson learned in life (I am mid 40s):
EVERYONE is scared, EVERYONE is faking it, EVERYONE has doubts
You don't remember, but your wish just has been granted: 

It was the year 2037 and you prayed: "Ow man I wish I could wake up, and be in my 30's(or 20's?) again..." That last part is crucial. They *are* humans and I’ve told myself that many times, but to this day I still have that mental block. Like right now, there’s a coworker of mine I think is really cute. And I could see myself having a good time with her, but a part of me just...blocks me. This sounds like a cautionary tale but now I want salvia. Someone here on Reddit shared a story of how he got into a car collision and he knocked out for about like a couple minutes or less but within that time frame he was “unconscious” and says that he lived a long, vivid, and detailed life; from getting the job he wanted to meeting his wife and having kids. Then one day, he’s just sitting in his living room and the lamp just looks odd. He was fixated on the lamp for days and his family was worried but he could not let it go. His wife and kids eventually left the house scared of his behavior and one day the lamp started to contort even more until it sucked him in and he wakes up at the scene of the car collision distraught and disoriented wondering where his family was and everything else that he lived through for what seemed to be like 22 years if I remember correctly. Salvia seems to do the same thing from what I’m reading here. Wish I could find that story again.Bounced on my boys dick to this commentBlubbery. I said blubbery. Probably why you can't hear a damn thing.Reminds me of /r/Superbowl.But you’re not THE EmilyI mean, you're the one who asked me out, right?I would have just cried like the bitch I wasI feel you, friend. 

My dad died in June. He took his own life. I think about him every day. He was the person I always turned to for advice, and, with the way things have been going for me recently, I feel that I need his advice now more than ever. It's been so tough without him.

I hope you're doing okay. Hang in there. Seek help if you need it; I know how hard it can be.I hope you’re doing okay, too. You made me tear up a little. This is such a feeltrain :(It terrifies me too. My mom had me when she was basically 40 so the fear is worse for me. I worry that my parents won't be around to see me get married, have kids, and really have my shit together. 

But today, for the first time ever, I was able to buy my parents a pricy gift and not worry about missing the cash later. I've never been more happy to see my mom cry. I feel like I'm getting there. The other problem with dreams is that you tend to forget them pretty fast after waking up.

That earth-changing event on 9/11?  Shit, what year was that...

I need to buy stock for what companies again?  Crap, they were PC related right?  

Email addresses weren't even a thing when I was 14...Maybe you should just listen to your subconscious more. Of course, if *this* is just a dream then I'm really just your subconscious so obviously I'm going to say thatI think he still isn't the sharpest tool> As well as do so great in high school that scholarships come in easy.

That was my first thought. 

Then I realized that I could have worked as many summer jobs and after school jobs as possible and invested all of it in Microsoft.I had bad ADD in high school that wasn't diagnosed until university. I could have saved so much money on scholarships if 14 year old me knew he needed a prescription to not think about anything from girls and games to rakes and fucking towels in the middle of class.Buy a moderate amount of bitcoins just in case?then invent bitcoin

(except i don't actually understand how it works despite the many times i've tried.)Well... um... the human butthole can only stretch so much. I don't think it is possible to shit the oven.

^^^^^^^^^/sI think he meant to give him a minute to realize he's just gonna go to college again and still have college loans in the end, so he just prolonged his eventual suffering.i'm 30. thing is, if i retained all of my memories, i've already had plenty of fun years. besides, i'm sure i'd still have fun even though i'm in college at a young age.. shit i've got the mental capacity of an adult, i'm sure i could figure something out. plus, perhaps being 14 again would mean i'd still have my memories but my brain wouldn't have the damage that i'm sure my 'funnest years' placed onto it.Except you already lived the fun years of your life in your dream. You're basically getting an extension on life with the benefits of youth. Imagine how much power you could amass having knowledge of things in the future. You could get rich very quicklyyou must have not been in school for a while

Problem is you dreamed it. 

So for instance, If you woke up and the OSI model had 12 layers, list is a command but not ls, port 50 is for http and 500 is https. 

All those functions and scripts you came up with? Those don't actually work because the compiler reads it differently. 

Oh, and when Xerox became the largest tech company in the world? They released XerOS, which uses a completely different set of commands and structure that was found to be better than what you learnt as a kid. Ohio University brah best ~~four~~ seven years ever!

Edit: fixed my strikethrough My college is probably harder than high school, it just sucks less because it's mostly stuff I actually want to learnToo be fair, math and science homework wasn't the problem, it was essay writing and all that other bullshit. In college it was almost all math and science. Technically more difficult but I just didn't hate doing it.
Man but think of all the 18 year olds you’ll get to bang again!!Frig off!He’s takin his pants off! You don't need sunscreen if you never go outside. 

*taps head*THIS. Tinnitus is torture.I like this. Too much!This. The things I'd do to hear silence again.I'll fucking tell you that. I'm 16 now, and I've got tinnitus. I can't even remember where it came from.
It really sucks, because I want to be a sound engineer or musician. I will preach it to anyone who wants to hear, use god damned earplugs, because you can't unfuck your ears.Be kind to your knees - you'll miss them when they're gone.Just don't get it stuck in any stupid places.By 14 I was already anti-social, hell, I think I was already when I was 6. I've often wondered when those skills really develop and if by your teenage years it's too late to change. I'm in my 40's now and see that it's something that's held me back my entire life in all sorts of ways. It's not even just about having friends, it's about being comfortable with people, which makes everything easier. Charisma is a powerful thing. I don't see why that would matter. It's like a 30 second scene explaining why humans are held captive by the machines. Batteries or processors, it's just sci-fi backstory for the sci-fi Kung fu before you. Which is a TV show for people in the matrix one meta level higher.I hate you guysWoah. Oh yours'd be a good story? Must be nice*Generation gap intensifies*Same here as well. 18 years and it still hurts. 6 years here my dude. The best advice I ever received was from a buddy who lost his brother, when I asked him if it ever goes away, "It never goes away, you just get better at dealing with it.

I know that sounds almost worse, but it really becomes one of those "change the way you look at things, and the things you look at change" parts of life. Nowadays, I think more about the cool things he and I had done together, and less about the cool things we could still be doing. 

If you ever need someone to vent to, talk to, anything, feel free to message me on here. What i went through after is something I would never wish on anyone. If I can impart any form of positivity to someone who is going through what I did, I will do so without hesitation. I did some real dumb shit after he died, and never want to see that happen to someone else.Oh manMy best friend died 2 days before we graduated high school. That was nearly 4 years ago and I think about him every day.It's been 11 years for me and it's still tough. It gets easier but the good thing is that the hurt you feel every once in awhile is the good memories hitting you.  His/her life lives on through thoae.  Learn to cherish them.   Wishing you the best.Inner Light - Season 5, ep 25

>An alien probe controls and disables Captain Picard, who wakes up as "Kamin," a resident of the planet Kataan. While the crew of the Enterprise tries to jar the probe's influence, "Kamin" lives through the final, dying decades of his homeworld in the span of approximately twenty minutes in the form of an interactive "ancestor simulation".

A civilization discovered that their sun would soon explode and destroy their world.  Not having the technology to escape their fate, they built a single probe that allowed someone to experience an entire life in their world as it had been.  Honestly, a really heavy episode.  At the end, when Picard stares out his window into the abyss of space, he puts down his flute and realizes he holds the only living memory of an extinct civilization.  I bawled.  

"Now we live in you. Tell them of us... my darling."



Before watching that episode, I had read reviews all saying that that episode launched the waterworks on them. I rolled my eyes and thought to myself that it wouldn’t happen to me. 



In the final scene, Picard opens his eyes, and I still hadn’t shed a tear. So I was feeling pretty triumphant. 


Then, in the last few seconds before it faded to black, he played the melody. And I broke down crying 😭😭😭😭So? Would absolutely fart up a classroom for nachos. Nausea? Bring it onYup. The short-lived TV show Journeyman had him dealing with the fallout of changes made in the past. At one point, his son becomes a daughter when he returns from a trip. He's heartbroken because the child he loves and remembers is gone. Meanwhile, his wife is adamant he not try to change anything back because she has memories and love for the daughter. Especially that guySomebody linked it in that thread too. http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/The_Inner_Light_(episode)Where I'm at now, kids can get hassled by the cops if they're out doing stuff, and there's a damned 10pm curfew. Staying at home on the internet is pretty much all that's fair game and universal experience for them now. 

at 14 I'd make stuff. I made music, it was the past so we did shit like that.  I'd get other people round and make stuff together then put it in front of people, get small sexy rewards, etc.  Then we all fall out. Get a nice time out of it though. 

If you are 14 I recommend that. 14 is a bit of a shitty age IMO. 17+ is when it gets better. But cultivating a creative side benefits the social bits now and forever. People like makers. I mean, I skateboarded a lot. I also smoked a ton of weed. 

The internet would have been safer. Kids these days... Back in *my* day kids were going out and using dangerous drugs when they were 14!🙁 If everyone enjoyed jumping off a bridge would you enjoy it too? 

/s, I'm not a dad so I can't technically use that yet. Internet all you want, my friendbaby don't hurt me.Aww.It was a dream. Bitcoin doesn't even really exist.This is exactly what I was thinking. I would have out $300 in. I was making $10hr cash at my first job at 16. I'd just be watching it like a hound. I also wouldn't have went to the same college I did and I sure as shit wouldn't have slept with the girl I did at 16 either.Given the spike it went through on the route to $1,000, I feel like you're probably talking more the difference between hitting $900 and $1,000 than the difference between hitting $500 and $1,000.

The volume of bitcoin you'd horde (especially if you were smart about not making it super obvious) would probably more than offset the lower valuation you'd cause.Yeah. If I woke up to be 14 in 1987 I'd probably convince my parents to invest $10,000 in Microsoft stock. It would become $1M by beginning of 1999. Then invest that $1M in Apple stock which would become $100M by 2015. And then invest those $100M in bitcoin and have 3 BILLION dollars by now...


And now I'm imaging how I would try to convince my parents that I'm from the future...There are a lot of these people. Including me, where as i am not really afraid of rejection, but my mind is telling me "Why should she" so i don't even ask at all. 


But you know the girl that looked at you, and you thought about "I'd like to talk to her"?

Chances are that she thought the same, but was afraid herself.

That happens very often. It's sad, but true.Yeah complete ego loss and simply...taking in... sensory input from your surroundings is a humbling, confusing, terrifying experience. There's no "trip" to be had, so to speak. There's an anesthetizing aspect to it that's undeniable. And hard to describe, starting with tiny, prickly feelings on the skin, followed by a strange feeling of being rolled into your side, even if you're laying flat on your back with your arms and legs splayed, that comes in waves with no beginning or end, like shepard tones, but with touch, not sound.

  Then, you probably won't remember much that's easily describable. The 2 dimensional flattening of the world that sometimes accompanies it is almost impossible to put into words. The feeling of pushing open a set of doors made of treacle in front of you, like the motion you'd imagine yourself making if you were trying to open a giant Venus fly traps mouth from the inside, even though to the outside observer your arms are extended out sideways like you're making snow angels. It's such a disconnect. Maybe you'll "see" geometric shapes or millions of tiny spheres moving along a track  or something similar. I use quotation marks around the word "see" because at that point the very idea of your senses don't really mean much.  Then you return to your senses, you get this feeling that someone just played a trick on you, even if you're the only person around. [deleted]Story time. When I was about 17 and still living at home, my friend Joe had obtained some salvia. Not only that, but Joe fancied himself some type of botanist/amateur chemist, and he had somehow extracted the active ingredients from the salvia (some type of sieve and alcohol) and of course gave some to me. 

I literally had no clue what salvia was but proceeded to smoke this concentrated salvia powder out of a water bong. A whole big bowl. Huh.. I don't feel anything.. maybe I should smoke another entire bowl. Seems logical. 

Sometime immediately after I finished the second bowl I awoke kneeling in the corner of my room sweating profusely. I was in a new world. As I walked by my tv that was on I remember seeing a Chevy "like a rock" commercial where at the end a ton of bricks come falling down on the Chevy logo.. when those bricks hit the logo.. it was if it had hit me. I fell flat to the floor. Or I should say through the floor. 

Wake up again... look at the tv.. Frasier is on. I cannot overemphasize how real it was when Frasier himself turned and started talking directly to me. He didn't want just casual conversation either.. he had a message to deliver to me.. the world was ending. I couldn't believe it, but he convinced me. So much so, that I ran out into the dining room area outside of me sleeping mother's room, screaming at the top of my lungs in just my underwear, still sweating profusely: "mom, wake up.. the world is ending, the world is ending!" Haha. Holy fuck.. she comes running out.. "boy, wtf are you on?" My bro was pretty wild, this wasn't her first rodeo!

Takes me to bed, gets me a cold rag on my head, and calls my gf  at the time.. finally got to Joe and his parents, all at 3 in the  morning.  All in all, she wasn't even mad, just worried and freaked the fuck out. Lol. I can only imagine waking up to that. 

She was a good mom. I miss her. Happy Thanksgiving to all.. appreciate time with your loved ones.

i remember reading that too. no clue how to find it though. r/blubberyearsmaybe she wasShe's someone's THE Emily.Well that’s not metal at all. Maybe that's why they didn't tell you then. They found the girly look rather fitting.I considered my dad one of my best friends. I'm utterly heart broken.

I was already in therapy for PTSD but this added depression and bi-polar disorder to the list. I made a doctor's appointment to start the process of getting anti-depressants and hopefully an anti-anxiety.

I literally have to smoke weed just to feel tired at this point. I worked a 14 hour day on Tuesday and I still struggled to get to sleep. 

I never considered being so young without my dad. I hope everyone is doing oke, life is tough man I just realized some people in this thread are much older than me and therefore would lose a lot more of their life experiences and be teleported to a much further point in time. I was 14 in 2011.Yeah and the fact that you'd be in a body of a 14 years old, influenced by the hormones and everything, so even if you'd remember who knows how you'd react. Most chance are you're gonna act like you're better than what you should have learned and think this dream was bullshit. You misspelled Bitcoin.Are “fucking towels” a thing you thinking about in the middle of class or are you actually fucking towels in class. Just curious...Best answer well not with that attitudeHe doesn't necessarily have to repeat his life though so I'm still not getting it. I'd take 5 more years of zero responsibility over getting rich. I get that, but I still think the difference is overstated.

Sure, it might take me a while to get used to XerOS, but computing is still computing. Programming languages are each just a different viewpoint on the same landscape. Operating systems are just an ecosystem, plus I've migrated twice already, why not again?

Also, Windows is definitely king when I'm 14, not XerOSLots of people go to college for 7 years. They're called doctors.Lol it was opposite for me - I’m cool with essay writing but math and sciences I struggled with in hs. Agree with you completely here. I like to read. I like to write. However, I hated writing essays >againIt’ll be a fun new experience ^if ^^it ^^^ever ^^^^happensUsername is friggin' relevant.Get the frig out of here!usually randy is pretty easy to knock over, but when he takes his pants off he can get right down there, and hes pretty fucking hard to knock over then!I dont know who you are, but you're clearly doing life right.Because people often dispute that humans would be counterproductive for batteries, but being used as processors makes more sense.A good story like someone's time spent in a prison camp might make for a good storyMuchly. By the time disco arrives, I'll be making a *killing* on new wave and punk.I appreciate you. I'm sorry for your loss and I hope to one day deal with mine better. Her and I did sooo many cool things together, and I'm grateful for that. I'm not sure if I will be able to let go of the useless desire to have done more before she left, though. For some reason, I can never stop thinking of the places we could have gone and how many more smiles I could have seen on her face. It eats at me every day. 

However, you have motivated me to try to start thinking differently and I thank you for that. My therapist said basically the same thing in July when I lost a son. And I was angry and hurt. However, almost five months later, I appreciate what she said. Still hurts like hell, but it's a different, better degree of hell. It's not something I can explain very well at all. I've heard that once you pass all the "firsts", things tend to level out a little better. You know, like today is that first Thanksgiving without my son; that first Christmas is coming up; and so on.I second this. You couldn't have said it better. Pain is normal and it took me a long time to realize that. You can try to reject the pain through substance use and other stupid things but it's just a normal response from the void of happiness that once existed. Don't associate pain as a "bad" feeling. Instead, embrace it and eventually you'll learn how to deal with it. Don't give up. There was a pretty profound effect on him. He went from hating kids to caring about them (in his way) after the experience of raising a family.I convinced my fiancée to use the orchestral version of the musical piece from that episode in our wedding. It is one of my top three favorite TNG episodes and I believe that associating that music with a memory I will cherish for my entire life epitomizes the message of the episode.After watching that episode, I went and learned the melody on my pennywhistle.

Now I can bawl my eyes out whenever I want!That was a good one, but the one where Data builds a daughter and she dies at the end always brings me to tears. 

"Thank you for my life, Father." :'(

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnyuNK5dv8&sns=emI really need to rewatch Next Gen. So good.Man I enjoyed that show.  Sadly short-lived.

Also, the movie About Time had a similar plot where he turns his daughter into his son (or vice versa, I can't remember) by time traveling."First aired: 1 June 1992"

Sometimes I forget how many things I love are older than I am.Thats...really sad.  Both the outside world and the internet world are important to have fun experiencing.  You know you're old when you want to live children's lives vicariously. but dad I AM the one jumping off the bridgeI mean, if everyone else is, then there's probably something to this jumping off of bridges thing.[Relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1170/)Step 1: Invent BitcoinWhat if you're Satoshi all along?Hell, when I was 14 you could still mine them at home..."Mom, tonight I dreamed of something called *Microsoft stock*, but that's about all I can remember from it. It was a strange dream but by now I've forgotten what it was about..."

"It's not important, dreams aren't real, Vahanik. Now prepare for school and don't forget your lunchbox!"I'm not afraid of rejection, I'm afraid of she going with "wtf this creep how does he dare" to all my friends. Which has happened before.Yeah this is a very good description of what it is like especially the part about the outside observer and the part about what you experience being impossible to put into words or describe to someone else accurately.

When I was younger I did a dose of 25x in my friend's shed in his backyard. The only way I can describe the trip is like this : "I was, Toy Story"

Although it is impossible somehow I was the size of a toy and jumping all over the surfaces and objects inside the shed as if it was a video game. It felt so real, I was sure I was small and the entire essence of the movie Toy Story was in me. I had to escape I had to get back to Andy.

When I came back to reality I was sitting there on the floor like what the fuck. I am not even a big fan of Toy Story so I have no idea why that was the subject of the trip so to speak but yeah...

Crazy shit. Yeah you've sold meMy experience was similar. I wish I wasn’t at a party though because it freaked me out. I didn’t even know I was under the influence of anything. And when I got the feeling of rolling on your side and everything looked sideways. I thought that’s how life was going to be from now on and I accepted that and began to prepare for my new life. Different experiences but i always got that "someone just played a trick on you" feeling. One time it was like I was two clicks off in time difference and was desperate to sync up with everyone elses time. I felt connected to the universe. However, there was a moment that I was concerned for my sanity and wondered if I would ever come off this high - - and if this state of mind would be permanent. Thus, I learned the importance of holding onto memories and moments, being mindful that my consciousness (and by extension reality) at one point felt like it was being held on by a string. 🤔First time I did salvia was before I'd done any dissociative or psychedelics before. Been smoking pot for years and it's all I had to go on. First time was on Xmas with a mate and we got 80x salvia, packed a cone like we would pot and....my world dissolved. One of the most life altering experiences I've had. It was disturbing yet I'm glad I did it. It opened my eyes up to what was possible with perception. I went on to do LSD and mushrooms and while I'd say they were both 'better experiences', I do not regret taking salvia yet would not do it again. There's a certain fear that comes with that particular experience..a feeling that if you go too deep there's no conceivable way you could possibly return the same.> I spent time with inter-dimensional beings who taught me a life time of lessons in the span of three minutes.

But those fucking bubble frogs man, they wouldn't tell me shit. They just kept floating around and bursting into more bubble frogs. 

I just wanted to know how why the walls were made of staircases with fractal patterns going on into infinity. My first and only time my eyes closed and my head dropped back and flew off into darkness like a balloon. Then there were a bunch of snakes. Yeah. Salvia.I was a pirate ship. Laying stomach down like a starfish on the floor with my limbs slightly raised, rocking back and forth making whoosing noises like waves. My friend however was trapped in a room with the only exit having tetris blocks falling into it that he had to constantly climb. My other friend kept getting up and walking around the room, when asked what he was doing afterwards he responded "Making sure all the doors were still there".>But first, I was a tree.

Awesome r/writingprompts material right there Well then it would probably be illegal since she would be fucking a 14 year old.Damn bro. Too real.^I was 14 in 1999, since then, I've had a half dozen cars, went from no cell phone, to flip phones, to the computers we have now, bought two houses, bought drugs off of the dark web, and lost the majority of my family members. It would be going back to a completely different world, I'd probably go crazy if I remembered this dream clearly after waking up. Same. 14 wasn't that long ago.Let's see here... Multiply by 5... Add 15... Carry the 1... Integrate the square root...

I would lose more years of my life than you've been alive.Same, losing six years is big, but it's unlikely you've built an entire life in that time period which will just go away. If anything it might be kinda nice if you aren't doing great, like getting a do-over while the memories relatively fresh. Make it twenty years or even just ten and you might have a whole life built up that just dissappears into nothing.Yes.I know I would choose community college over ITT.You are correct. As complex as it is, programing and all our technology is based on rational philosophy and number theory that's thousands of years old. It's one of the reasons why learning one programing language enables you to easily adapt to others.  Not really, where is all that extra brainpower coming from? This isn't Lucy, we don't use 10% of our brains. If the people were still conscious and acting normally in the Matrix then they don't really have any brainpower left over to be used as calculators. 

Only thing that makes sense to me is the Matrix is an animal preserve. The machines didn't hate us, we were just too dangerous to be left in charge. So they made us our fancy cage, and they recoup as much power as they can while keeping us alive and happy.Like the book, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich. Literally an entire novel just about a single day in a gulag.  Great read. Gen Y (early 80s one at that), I'll be right behind you manufacturing happy pants, slouch socks and hypercolour t-shirts. We'll be killing it.I am glad I did. It's not something you'll figure out in a day, but over time it will change. But seriously, take what time you need to grieve and don't feel guilty doing so. I didn't have that benefit, and I think it caused a lot of the issues I went through. I was a touring musician at the time, I was on the road when he died, and I was back on the road a week after the funeral. 10 months a year. I didn't go through the actual grieving process for years after it happened. There's no guilt or shame in handling things the way they need to be handled.Hey I'm not as eloquent as the other person and they said pretty much what I had to say, but I'll also extend my sorrow for You, and you can PM me anytime you need to talk to. (I'm not good st advice, but I'm a good listener!)I am so sorry for your loss, and from what you said, it was definitely recent. I have lost a brother, my best friend, but I could not even begin to understand the feeling of losing a child.

Just you being here to make this comment shows just how strong you are. That strength is absolutely admirable.
“There are two primary choices in life: to accept conditions as they exist, or accept the responsibility for changing them.” ~ by Denis WaitleyFor me it was the Deep Space Nine episode "In Purgatory's Shadow," when [Enabran Tain confessed his pride in Garak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gV9t9Db4nkE). I never felt that sort of pride from my own father, so it hit me like a ton of chopped onions.God, what a fantastic show. I'm so fucking happy TNG exists. Voyager. Where the doc runs a holo program with a family. His daughter has an accident asks him if she’s going to die. “You’re too sick to get better.” Fucking onions everywhere I never stop watching, I just constantly cycle through each yearAnd comments like that make me feel old.But you can't go outside all by yourself! There are scary people out there who will kidnap you or mug you!  -My completely insane parents...

I am 14. I can't wait until I can drive and maybe I will escape this prison they call a "house"If you jumped off a bridge, wouldnt you want all your friends to jump too?Haha this was my argument too. "I mean, my friends are all decently sane, so if they're all jumping there's probably a damn good reason for it."why can't you still mine them at home?Shit, when I was 14 the only mining I could do was with peons. I still hear "Yes milord" in my sleep.Yeah, you're right :(

To be honest I'd actually have to go back to 2009 because that's when I was actually 14. But being 14 in 1987 sounds like fun.

btw, username checks outOn to the next. As a bisexual female, I somewhat understand the straight male's predicament. It's much much harder to get a girl to even consider you as a sexual partner than it is to get a man. All i have to do to get a man is go outside. But a woman. Oh my freakin gosh. Don't come on too strong, don't come on too weak, make sure she knows you're interested, hope she doesn't change her mind or get scooped up by billy by the end of the night. Which has happened to me. Fucking billy. And of course, knowing how to communicate needs and what we're comfortable with, might be easier for me as another woman, not sure, but men tend to skip this step. If they reject you and laugh at you, meh, there's more. Try and get more shameless. Women like that. I have herpes so I've been rejected by handfuls of women and men. Also sometimes women just reject me. Men never do unless they are scared of herpes. Which is fine. Move to the next. Good luckFirst time I tried it I happened to be looking at a can of Mug's Root Beer, the one with the bulldog on it. Well sure enough that bulldog started talking to me, inviting me to visit his colorful little world...on the side of the can I guess? I just kept focusing on the can and the dog coaxing me to cross over. I got a quick glimpse of this weird and visceral hallucinated world before my friend asked if I was feeling it and I snapped back to reality.

7/10 would try to hallucinate my way into pop can cartoon world again.I was a treadmill and the AOL running man was running on top of me. I too did salvia for my first time in a shed in my friend's backyard. Wasn't a guy named Daniel by any chance was it? 
I see your username, if it means you're Canadian I'm hoping you're someone I know. Ah reminds me of the time I did 100x with a bunch of middle-schoolers in a concrete runoff ditch surrounded by foliage. At one point in my trip I was a clock on a wall in a school hallway just looking down at students walking by. As I came out of my trip I though I was in the jungle and bolted up and tried to run out of there.[deleted]Be careful. Many don’t think it can happen to them but these types of drugs CAN seriously fuck up your physical, mental, and emotional well-being for long after dosing. Sometimes these effects (like ego-loss) can be permanent. 

Safe travels.   On the flip side all it did to me was make me feel like someone cranked the gravity up to 100 for about 3mins and just made me frustrated as a result.

YMMVI prefer DMT.I feel like salvia is like a very dirty and scary DMT trip. Lower strengths can be fun but man it can be very very unpleasant and uncomfortable. And I say this as a person who loves psychedelics, OBEs and ego-lossUhh, I would STRONGLY recommend a ton of research before getting into the 40x or more potent stuff. It is NOT a joke. That was literally the most accurate description I've ever read. That feeling of being tricked is pretty profound. Almost like "you" were a higher dimensional entity tricked by another higher dimensional entity. Scratch that. 


The door opening thing was akin to like, realizing   your entire reality (not just your life, but your whole EVERYTHING) is a cell in a much more complicated "organism". Imagine what it would be like to be a skin cell that became self aware. Aware that all of your activities and relationships were pretty much pre-programmed functions, for a purpose you couldn't comprehend.  It's pretty bizarre.Acceptance and letting go of control are two things one needs on psychedelic trip. Like if you feel you are going to die . Accept it .not That easy to do but try to do it.Normally I'm not a fan of single emoji responses, but I honestly can't think of a better response than "🤔"Me and a buddy who are both experienced with tripping on various shit tried this, think 25x.
I went first and as I released the hit the last thing I remember looking at were the bars on his pet furry beast cage.
The world did indeed seem to flatten, then spread to infinity in a kind of desert the colour of the sand in that cage. Then I felt like the bars were like wires being dragged across my skin over and over with an aim to rip out my soul.
I fought this because I didn't want to lose my soul then kind of settled down a bit and let shit happen because I know to fight the feelings/emotions/thoughts of a trip can get freaky.
Maybe a little too soon after me my friend took his hit. He immediately ran towards his flat screen TV in the corner screaming. I diverted him just in time towards his wall where he clawed at the side of his window blinds screaming for his wife. I had to basically grab him and push him into his bedroom onto his bed where he whimpered for a while.

After we both decided we felt like we'd nearly died in a car accident or something, totally shook up and drained.
He never did it again and I never did anything above 10x.

The last time I did it with any major effect I believed I was a whole roast chicken and was revelling in how crispy and brown my skin was. For me it was outdoors, on a clear sky full of stars, which turned into this glorious atmosphere of rainbow encompassing the entire skyline. I heard the phrase "Crotepula" repeated louder and louder with each saying as I fell further and further into this colorful abyss. No insights, no profound revelations. Just "Crotepula" over and over and rainbows as an indistinguishable face appeared, supposedly the source of the phrase. And then I was almost immediately back to my senses.

Don't do drugs.

Edit: Just in case I ever run for office: This never happened.Wouldn't she be 14 also I was 14 in 1986, so yeah... it’d be very weird to wake up and remember that I had 2 kids older than that just a moment ago.
But it’d be awesome to see my dad again.But then you get to buy all the drugs again!I'm 20 currently, hope your math worked outThat was my thoughts too. At my age, I'd be losing my 2.5 years of college and all of high school. Sucks dick, but I could prolly name off right now the majority of the major fuck ups from that period of time and hopefully be able to make a change. But 10 years? 20? No way.Thanks for clearing that up for me.That was my thinking, too. Maybe the programming in the machines prevented them from completely wiping out humanity, so they were obliged to keep some humans alive. Knowing that having too few humans might lead to genetic abnormalities and eventual extinction of the species, the machines, in abundance of caution, kept a few million alive hooked up to the Matrix. And as you say, since they had to keep humans alive, might as well try to benefit from some byproduct heat.Oh my, someone needs to watch the Animatrix. This is exactly what they did. The machines decided we were a problem, and that what we did to the planet would wipe us out. So they did the only thing they could, preserve us as best as possible in a menagerie. The original Matrix was a paradise, but humanity was too destructive, it did not work. By giving humans a flawed world, a broken cage, the machines were able to continue working on more important projects. Such as Project Aeolus- A way to restore the skies back to normal. 

The machines did not need humans for processors or power, they had the vast sands of sahara and gobi, even the large plains of salt lake. No, they also had Thorium, enough power to last untold millenia. The machines needed the time to fix the world, and decide if humanity was fit to be released.> One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich

Read the wiki article on it. Sounds amazing. I'll pick it up, thank you for the tip.A friend of mine lost a daughter right around the same time; we have each other to lean on. That helps.

I think this has been harder on my oldest son, who lost his little brother (they're 28 and 26 this year). They were born 18 months apart and behaved a lot like twins in so many ways. 

Thank you. I appreciate you.I liked the DS9 episode where Sisko gets trapped in a time rift and drifts in and out of his son's life, watching him grow up, become an author and get old, as Sisko stays the same age.My parents were like that. They eventually eased up around high school. Wish you the best of luck. Well you can but unless you buy 6 AMD graphics cards and live in a low power cost area you're gonna get fuck all out of it.Second this.  

Did it twice. The second time I experienced the "2 dimensional flattening of the world" mentioned above, in the motion of someone flipping pages. Page after page of reality fell down on me.  I thought I was dying and going to the afterlife, passing through various possibilities of reality.  Felt like it went on forever.

Eventually the pages stopped flipping, and I had landed back in our reality. I Hadn't moved from my chair and everyone was just staring at me.  Apparently I just sat and sweat the whole time, and it had been maybe 3 minutes.Salvia was one of if not the most terrifying and surreal, yet fascinating things I have ever experienced. I went deep. No audio or visual input from this reality was perceived. I was quite literally in another, completely alien world yet at the same time was in my past as a non living object. For about 20 minutes after my trip ended I was positive I came back into the wrong dimension/reality, it was horrifying. I still try to wrap my head around it all and am completely fascinated by the experience. I haven't found the courage to do it again and I love bending time and space with substances.Good lord that cameraman sounds like the worst human being.It *is* the best emoji.That last part though... Lmfao > Edit: Just in case I ever run for office: This never happened.

Your username is *enemawatson*.Back in his day maths wasnt a thingIn all seriousness, fucking was an adjective there and not a verb. I specifically said that because one time in some science class (can't remember which one, I think grade 11 physics) I was zoning out really badly during a huge lesson and my buddy tapped on my shoulder after like 30 seconds and goes *dude what the fuck are you thinking about*

Of course I went *I'm thinking about rakes and fucking towels* really loudly without even realizing I was supposed to be paying attention to the lesson. Three laws of robotics applied to a suicidal species.That's why you build malware to make other people's computers do it. 


(Don't do that, that's a dick thing to do)I found the 2D flattening of the world to be amazing. It was like the green wall in front of me fell flat on the ground, then stretched out into an infinite plane. "I" seemed like I consisted only of my two eyeballs, laying right on the green plane. It was pretty amazing. I felt like I landed in my body after that trip.

A much lighter trip was pretty fun too. I decided to see what would happen if I sat infront of a flatscreen TV playing a cheesy zombie comedy movie. My friends watched to keep me from running into the TV or jumping out the window lol. What happened was amazing. A zombie hand must have been coming into frame from the left side of the TV screen. In my "vision" I saw a line of these hands growing out of my wall. I was laughing and trying to high-five them in my mind. My friends tell me I was just sitting there going "Huh huh huh" in a really deep voice.

Another experiment I did ended up being my new salvia routine. - total darkness. At night before bed, I would take a massive bong rip and while holding it in I would run across my room and kill the light switch, then dive back into my bed. I had this really thick comforter that was amazing feeling, even when sober. Once my trip kicked in, I was basically swimming in a sea of comforter, flopping around in my bed on what felt like massive waves of pleasure/softness.It's amazing how our Brains can produce such immersive, consuming, and convincing experiences entirely within us; while there could be several individuals within arms' reach who are taking part in equally complex but vastly different self-synthesized events- none of you aware or able to communicate with the other, perhaps not even existing to each other, for some time. And then we return to the heavily interwoven relationships and shared existence of our immediate physical environments.This is how acid was for me! Flipping pages, but like I was zooming out infinitely and then back into myself again, a ride I could not get off of. My friend tells me I sat by a fence looking up, alternating crying and laughing as I went through wavesever worry you landed on the wrong page?That's so interesting. I'd never heard of the "2d" effect, but it so accurately describes the experience I had. I did it twice also. I was trying to get 25x, but all they had was 60, so the first time I hit it was out of a bubbler in the forest and it was really amazing and peaceful. Was sitting on a bench and got the flattened feeling along with some really subtle translucent visuals. Second time I hit it from a bong in my friends driveway. He went first and by the time I was inhaling, I looked up and noticed him crying and was like wtf?! It was too late though and I got those uncontrollable giggles and disappeared into my head. I completely lost my vision for idk how long, but got hit really hard with the 2d feeling and I felt like I was viewing myself outside of my body, but in this weird black void. I seriously felt like I was there for years and it was terrifying. I was just sort of trapped, floating/rotating tied to this weird paper doll chain. I couldn't move away from it no matter what I tried. My vision finally started coming back and my girlfriend and her friend we're trying to get me to sit down. Apparently I had gotten up and was just spinning in circles. When I looked at them I was seeing 3 horizontal layers of my gf and her friend. I thought they were different layers of reality or something and I needed to get centered on the one in the middle but I kept drifting up and down. They looked terrifying and evil in the bottom layer, but eventually I got on the right one and came down pretty quick. It fucked with my head for about a week though. I will never do it again. Fuck that. I had to check your username because a friend of mine had a very active trip like this. He said he felt that his entire life had been turned into a book. And someone “god” was turning the pages. He got to see his life play out, but realized that if the person kept flipping the pages he would get to the end of the book (his life) he started freaking out and asking the person to slow down, he wanted to enjoy life. But the person started flipping faster and faster. he started begging the person to let him live just a little bit longer, and then he came back to reality.

In the real world, he had been sitting down in the grass, got and started running for 30 feet. He looked scared to death and even though we were talking to him trying to “calm him down” he was visibly scared/afraid. He Dropped to his knees and looked hopeless, and when he came to, he had no idea how he got to the place he was. 

I honestly feel like the trip changed him, before we all tried it together he was very impulsive and crazy, often going street racing and being a playboy. He ended up selling all his street racing cars, married his wife and had a baby. All within 2 years. He completely changed and i still credit salvia for teaching him the value of life he wouldn’t have learned any other way.

Edit: what fascinated me about salvia was that when I would smoke it, often it would hit mid inhale so I would literally not remember completing the whole inhale/exhale of actually smoking it. It’s like taking a deep breath and then BAM you’re somewhere else. Ya.. I had a similar experience. No alien world but alien space. Entire room segmented into small kalidescopic pieces, moved inwards and interlocked like teeth of a zipper, then I went to this blue.. bright blue/white shifty space, and felt a presence there. I felt like I was "past life", not so much dead as just onto something else. But I was terrified, and thought "I'm not ready for this", and then felt acknowledgement and got sent back into the room. 

Tripped out hard for 20 more mins, became my friends arm, felt the stomach feeling as he lifted it up and down because I was it, I felt the motion of being his arm. Chair was talking to me. Ran up my friends shirt, because he became a giant and his shirt was green, so it was a big field of grass somehow. 

And then as I was coming to, shit I was looking at would randomly swirl, like a glitch. Like a little vortex/swirl distortion effect you can do in photoshop. And it was like I forgot what everything was. EVERYTHING. And my brain rapidly made sense of everyday objects one by one in the room. "Ok, that orange squiggly thing is an extension cord. That's a desk.", it was like a brain reset. Never again, my god. 

I've often wondered if I'm still on it, I read stories about people experiencing very long periods of time on it. I mean.. shit has gotten reeeally weird since then (9 yrs ago)Maybe.... you did come back to the wrong dimension.I had the same feeling like I came back into the wrong reality/dimension when I did it.So like the owner of Utorrent?How many times do you do it that you have a routine for salvia lmaoWell when you remember that you brain is basically everything you are, is easy to imagine how any thing you do to it can change our perception in such ways.One of my best experiences taking LSD was when my buddy and I dropped and our trips synced up or something weird. But we were seeing the same shit and experiencing the exact same things all night. It was such a weird intimate connection that we had all night, even as two hetero dudes. We never talk about the trip, cuz we were both there and nothing needs said, but I'm sure it was significant for him too.Also, who doesn't love a good fart joke?This just blew my mind. Then again I'm ridiculously high.[deleted]I was in a dance class a few years ago and we had to do improv. Everyone there was a WAY better dancer than me,so I had a difficult time just with that. Well,my teacher gave us 5 mins to come up with a dance to a whole song,and you'd have to dance in front of the class alone. I noped the fuck out of there and ran and hid in the bathroom. My cell phone was still in the classroom,but at that point I didn't care. I decided to sneak out the front door of the studio. Well there's a small problem there. The walkway to the parking lot was in front of the giant windows of my classroom. I decided to just duck down and run the best I could,hoping no one saw me. I made it to the car and had my Dad run in and get my phone. Didn't go back to my class for a few weeks there.One time when I was a kid, I was calling up a girl I liked to ask her if she wanted to hang out. Her mom answered the phone and in my awkward teenage bumbling I asked her mom if SHE wanted to hang out. 

I'm still not quite over that one, nearly 10 years laterClimbed a tree to get away from people at an outdoor party. Stayed there until everyone left and then went home.The other day at my small office I went to the bathroom to fix my shirt which I had worn inside out. When I went into the stall the bathroom was empty. As I flipped my shirt around someone walked into the stall next to me. I also used some toilet paper to wipe my nose (slight cold) and dropped the paper in the bowl. This triggered the auto flush sensor and it flushed. My predicament began when I realized I also had to pee, but since I had already used TP and flushed my twisted mind decided this would seem really weird to the person next door. "Why would someone use the bathroom, flush... and then stand up and pee again?" said no one ever... But I couldn't, they might recognize my shoes and know who I was.  
  
  
So instead I hatched a clever deception. I left the stall and washed my hands to seem normal, despite that I hadn't even used ths bathroom. After drying I walked loudly to the exit and opened the door into the hall, then I said "oh excuse me" like I had accidentally bumped into someone else coming in, and walked right back in. I made sure to change the sound of my footsteps walking more quietly so that stall-man would think I was a different person and not some freak playing bathroom charades. Then I went to the urinal and peed and then washed my hands again, using the farthest sink so he couldn't spot my shoes.TL;DR I faked an angry phone call because I was too afraid to just get out of line

I was picking up my little sister from school, and I didn’t have anything better to do and I didn’t want her to have to wait on the long Carline, so I got there 40 minutes early. About five minutes before school let out, she told me she was going home with a friend.  I was so scared that the people behind me in line would think I was creepy if I jus left the line after all that time, so I pretended to be on the phone, got out of my car and rummaged through my trunk while acting like I was angry at the person on the other end of the call, complete with annoyed arm movements and all, then got back in and drove off
After work, I decide to get a beer at a bar. I teach night classes on a side of town I’m not used to, so I go into random sports bar and I sit alone. I do not watch most sports. Later...

Me (in my mind): it’s getting late. I should go home.

Random guy: hey, this Texans game is good! Can’t believe (something footbally happened)

Me (pretending to know football stuff): yeah, these dudes are dope! The Texans are in for some trouble if they mess up!

Guy: FINALLY! Someone on my side!! 

The guy buys me beer. We are now best friends. Turns out we are the only fans of whatever the other team is in this bar. We bond over our outsider status. I have no idea what to say and as the night goes on, he keeps buying beer. I have pretended to like football for too long to come clean now. I end up watching the whole game. Our team lost. I didn’t get home until midnight It was 3rd grade. I had a presentation the next day that I really didn’t want to do so I took a hammer and sat in the backyard trying to break my own ankle. I just ended up bruising it because I couldn’t go full force. I'm from Ireland (a Catholic enough country). I deliver pizzas and one night a women said "god be with you" as I was walking away and I stumbled over my words and said "peace be upon you" like the fecking pizza Pope. Cringed pretty hard walking away as she just looked at me. 
Edit: toppings be upon you my children .I once got off the wrong bus stop on purpose because I didn’t want to tell the bus to stop, so I just waited for it to stop itselfI was buying a Zelda-themed wallet at an FYE once. The cashier asked me if I wanted a bag for it. I just stammered and said "No thanks, I'll just equip it now". 

_*No thanks, I'll just equip it now*_I once hid from my family when they came over for the holidays out of fear of interaction. I hid  especially from one of my cousins who was socially aggressive and just made me really anxious. I had nowhere else to hide where there wasn't people, so I went into my bathroom and hid under the sink (I was about 8) and just planned to stay there as long as possible. My cousin (the aggressive one) came in, took a long and winded shit and then left. I just stayed there and am to this day even more terrified of interacting with him. I saw nothing but I heard.... every... sound. Driving to a party, sat outside of it in my car the entire time, left. Next day, said I was there. When I was about 11, I stood in a room with my mom and her employees after an office Thanksgiving luncheon. They were chatting away about various things and we were all snacking. I took a bite of turkey and as I went to swallow it, it lodged in my throat. I kept swallowing as hard as I could but it wouldn't budge and I couldn't breathe. I didn't have a drink near me, either. So, I stood there attempting to get it down while giving NO INDICATION that I  was literally choking on my food... Because I didn't want to interrupt the conversation or draw attention to myself. My vision was starting to black on the edges and I was full-on panicking inside when I finally got it swallowed down. I  remember breathing heavy through my nose and my eyes watering, thinking how stupid I just was but now I DEFINITELY couldn't say anything about it.

Sometimes it feels like anxiety will kill you, sometimes it almost does.This one time I was approached by a highschool girl trying to get my contact info, I'm only 22 so I mean I guess I'm passable for just an older guy, but clearly you gotta say no, so me, being a Reddit user, said something stupid, I started to say "Sorry but I'm old enough to be your dad" but that was so dumb I changed it mid sentence to "sorry I'm old enough to be your brother" but that didn't make any sense so what really came out of my mouth was "sorry I'm old enough to be your.. Brother...s... College roommate" and then we both stood there in that amazing wtf feeling you get when you're just overloaded with wtf. My girlfriend was a server at a restaurant called Bonefish and she was supposed to ask "Have you ever dined at Bonefish?" but instead she asked "Have you ever boned at Dinefish?" She was mortified but her customers thought it was hilarious. Bartender asked me what my name was....I forgot and had to think about it. I was at a chipotle. The girl asked me how my day had been. I said “large please” because I got confused and thought she was asking what size I wanted. Then she asked if I wanted white rice or the other rice they had and I said “yes!”  Oh boy, my stomach is sinking as I recall this.

I did this twice in one week, by the way. I went over to my friend's house and when his dad opened the door and said, "Welcome!" I replied with "yes, welcome."

Edit 3: thank you u/Xacto01 https://youtu.be/C2-5mDyCKacThis moment haunts me still. It's kind of long-winded but I hope it paints the picture. 

About 15 years ago I was a young teen browsing the electronics section of Walmart. As I was leaving that area this guy and girl around my age were coming into the electronics area. They saw me and both enthusiastically said "Hey!!" like they were happy and surprised to see me. I didn't recognize them but I thought maybe we had a class together or something so I was like "Hey!! How's it going?!" feigning cheerfulness as I tried to place where I knew them from. They both looked at me weird and made a face then walked past me to a guy and girl behind me, greeting them. 


I was so embarrassed and anxious I just got out of the electronics department as fast as I could without running and went to the next department over... which ended up being ladies clothing, the bra and panty area. A female employee came over and asked if I needed help, looking at me confused because of the department. I was flustered and said, "Sorry just trying to find electronics" to which she replied "Oh it's over this way come with me". I didn't want to go back but now I was obligated so I followed her back and as we approached I saw the two teens i had the awkward interaction with and their two friends all look up and stare at me. "There ya go hun" the employee said then she started chatting with the cashier in electronics. 

At that time Walmart's electronics section was like a big square with only one opening for entrance and exit go deter theft so now I'm trapped in this area with the people I just had the awkwardness with and the employee that just escorted me from women's clothes. I was so embarrassed and my whole body felt hot from anxiety. I just blankly stared at the videogames behind the glass until the other people left and then I took off. 

Ugh.. 

Edit: Thank you stranger for the gold and the pity! Thank you all for sharing in my pain, giving me your support and letting me know this story made you laugh! I can't believe how popular this post became but I'm glad some of you got some joy out of my teenage awkwardness. 

Edit 2: To those who have mentioned it, yes I'm much better about stuff like this now. I can just say "Oops, thought you meant me" and laugh it off. This story hurts because when I think about it I can **feel** how I felt back then and it makes me cringe. Was at a picnic with some friends 10-15 people, turned into like 50-75 people within a hour. Enter extreme anxiety. Went up to grill to get hot dog. Cute girl walks behind me to get one, notice and start sweating. Barbecue homie hands me my hot dog, so nervous I drop it right onto the cement. Didn’t know to get another one so picked it up with dirt all over it, took a bite, and walked away.

Added bonus: a bush I’m really allergic too was near by so the next week I had an allergic reaction all over my body from it. 

Good times with my pal social anxiety. I went into a store I used to work at expecting to see my coworkers so I could greet them. A lady was there, but I had no idea what who she was. She asked me if she could help, and I stuttered a no.

Then I stood and kind of tapped my feet around like I was a fuckin tap dancer and I tried apologizing but instead said “I uh....I’m not looking for you.” She looked so confused and I could feel my face getting red. I literally ran out. Not just walked quickly- ran and slammed into the door(its heavy) and hurt my arm. 

Though injured, I trudged on. I heard her call out and ask if I was okay as I ran out. Now I can never go back. 


Edit: thank you kind stranger. Your gold made me cry, I’m glad to know this stupid embarrassing moment of my life really made people happy :)Walked into a bar that was packed full of people who had all come home for Christmas to my small town. I knew everybody there. I walked in, walked through the crowd, right past my sister, and out the back door. When my sister and I saw each other, she looked at me, like, oh fuck. You're freaking out I bet. She knows all about my social anxiety. She knew exactly what I had just done, and she thought it was hilarious.Asked a customer if her name was

"Kate spelled with a Kate" Not the weirdest, but pausing my music when I get in an elevator incase somebody says something. I can't look people in the eye. If I keep eye contact longer than couple of seconds I either feel this weird vibe like the other person is looking into my soul or some weird sexual tension. Like I get the urge to make out with them. I find long eye contact to be one of the most personal things I can do with someone. And it gets really noticeable after a while, especially during drinking in mixed company. EDIT: People, please stop responding to this. My inbox is in great pain.I'm a retail cashier. 
A woman was buying a dress and humorously stated that she might be too fat for it.
Me, never one to disagree with a customer, smiled and said, "Yup!"

I burned a few calories hitting my head on the counter after that exchange.


Edit: People are asking what happened afterwards. 
She didn't catch it right away, but as she walked off I think the penny dropped. 
I was left to wallow at my register for the remainder of my shift.My roommates and I hosted a party. I wasn't having a good night, and went into my room to find two people I didn't know making out on my bed. I said, "Please leave when you're done" and went in my friend's room instead to curl up and freak out.Walks past a cute girl 

Starts walking manuallyI hide when I have to make important phone calls at work. I hate phoning people, yet went and got a job that required it, which is ridiculous. I'll hide my caller ID and go take a walk to calm myself down then use my mobile to call clients away from the office so nobody is listening Mixed up "thank you very much" and "thank you ma'am", and said "thank you mom" to a bank teller. I once hid under a pile of blankets to avoid talking to someone I knew was coming up to my boyfriend's apartment for a few minutes. First time hanging with my middle school girlfriend and we literally said 4 words I had to pick something up from someone's house and was desperate for the loo, didn't want to ask to use the bathroom in their house so instead picked what I needed up, rudely rushed through small talk, basically ran to my car, drove far enough away they couldn't see me and then parked again and half pissed myself running into a bush.

Wasn't even the first time I'd been to that house...Living with roommates at the time, I was in my bedroom and had to pee really really bad but they were having a bit of a party. I decided to  stay hidden in my bedroom and pee in an empty water bottle so I didn't have to interact with people on my way to the washroom. One year of high school I didn't have anyone in my lunch period that I was friends with. So instead of making friends with the other kids there, I'd eat really fast then say I had to go study in the library, and would instead just wander around the halls until lunch was over. 

Except you weren't allowed to roam the halls like that, so I had to sneak around to avoid any teachers/hall monitors seeing me. I spent a lot of that time going from bathroom to bathroom, kind of just standing there waiting for time to pass. 

People keep asking these questions so here are the answers:

I didn't actually go in the library because I didn't want to spend my free time studying (I wasn't a huge fan of school in the first place.) Sneaking around was honestly more appealing to me. 

We didn't have lunch together because there were too many students to have them all in the cafeteria at once, so lunch was broken up into 4 mini periods. Some kids ate lunch while the others were still in class and rotated in and out of the cafeteria. That's why we weren't allowed to roam the halls.

Thanks for the concern but I wasn't a super sad kid back then or anything, and I'm totally fine now!

No, I'm not you. One time, I had to leave someone a voicemail. So I wrote out exactly what I had to say and read it like a script when I left the message. Something about making calls really gets me anxious and I forget what I was going to say. Or it gets jumbled. Scripts help. 

Although I am better at calls now. This was years ago. 


Edit: Maybe I should start doing this again from time to time. Even though I am better at calls because of my job, I still suck sometimes. A few weeks ago, I called someone named Tom at my workplace, and began with "Hi Megan, this is Tom.." I'm Megan. Oops. this guy was selling keychains on the street, he made them himself and as I was buying one he was telling me how he got over his alcoholism by going to this center where he learned to make said keychains. After the transaction was finished he said "thank you bye" and I replied "Cheers!!" while doing the cheers gesture.When I was in middle school the teacher had us all read a chapter aloud to the class. Nervously awaiting my turn to read I started to read aloud to the class while someone else was currently reading. Not only once but three times.I have gotten out of my car, walked up to the house of the party, then walked back to my car...then walked back up to the house, then back to my car until I finally texted my friend at the party, asking him to come get me outside so I wouldn't have to walk in front of the crowd alone. I have drove to university, I was 5 minutes late, stood outside the room, couldn’t walk in, drove home👍🏻 waste of petrolWalked past my classroom but didn’t wanna look stupid doing a freshman 180 so I circled alllllll the way around the building, missed it again, and walked to some random restroom nearby and sat in the restroom for like 5 minutes because I didn’t want people to recognize me as the dude who keeps doing laps around the fuckin Chem lab building [removed]Talking to my boss after a long day of exams and assignments. I go to leave and she catches the door before I can leave to say goodbye. For some reason my wired brain made me give her fingerguns and say "zoop" as I walked away. Thought about it the whole way home.I was going leave my room to make dinner but then I heard my roommates and their friends talking outside. I didn't want to talk to them so I waited until they left and just bought take out instead.My parents always bring up the time when I was 4 and we were at this Mexican restaurant. Apparently they started singing “Happy Birthday” to me, to which I smiled, but then got nervous and promptly, confidently, leaned over and bit my dad on the arm. 


Edit: Wow, my first gold! Thank you!!Back in middle school I literally ran away when someone was going to ask me to the school dance. In my defense, I really had to pee. I still feel bad about it though.Called my dad to pick me up from high school instead of pooping at school. I could probably be married by now if I would quit looking away every time I spy a woman trying to make eye contact with me. Skipped out on a really good job interview because they wanted me to do a presentation in front of a few people as part of the interview.A school friend of mine had invited me to a party at his house. The only person I knew there was him and 2 other people from my school I was not at the best of terms with.

The party was taking place at the roof of his house and it had an open setup with a small room which contained a bed and a tv.

I was tasked with bringing a console for the party and setting it up in that room. When i went in, I realised that the TV can't be connected due to lack of an hdmi port. However, at that moment, I heard music and hooting.

The worst of my fears had come true. People were dancing in a circle and everyone was being pushed into it one by one.  

So, naturally i stayed in that small room for the remainder of the party.
(around 1.5 hours).I recently moved to a new city, and there's a Subway across the street from my complex. I decided to go there for dinner and wanted to get a footlong for that night and another one for tomorrow. Except I'm a big guy, they wouldn't believe I wouldn't eat them both in one sitting. So being the idiot I am I ordered one for me and had my phone out pretending to get an order from my "brother." Pretty sure they knew, pretty sure they judged, jokes on me though, I ate them both in one sitting anyways. 

EDIT: obligatory thank you for the gold kind stranger! Also it's been really cool to see the comments of other people who have been in similar situations, or are using these posts to further look into their own poor eating choices. I know this experience was a wake up call for me, too, so I'm glad it's both being enjoyed and informative 😎There are a multitude but the one that comes to mind now. 

I’m a speech therapist in a school and I️ went to talk to one of the teachers about a student. I️ just so happened to find this teacher incredibly attractive at the time and tried to avoid him in the building sometimes to not embarrass myself blushing or stumbling over my words. 

Anyway, I️ go ask him about the student for a minute or 2. Turn around to leave the room. Miss the door by about a foot and walked straight into the wall. If someone ever comes to my door when I’m home alone, I’ll army crawl around my house, avoiding all the windows until I get to the stairway and I can listen until they leave. I still do this as a 20 year old woman. asked a worker in the mall for assistance the other day. she looked at me really weird and said she didn't worked there. i internally freaked out. i said "i know" and asked if she could still help, she agreed and turned around to walk in the direction i needed help (facing away from me) and i immediately power walked out of there. 

edit: thank you for the gold!Ooooooh, boy.

I was at the mall, not intending to spend much money at all. I was by myself and I tried to avoid all of those annoying mall salesmen that desperately try to bring you over to their booths.... Well, I looked at one of them and.... Ended up spending over 100 dollars on a nail-kit because I was too anxious to say no. 

My friends think Im an idiot. Honestly, I couldn't agree more.After graduating high school, I would sometimes drive to the next town to deposit my paycheck or get my oil changed. I didn't want to run into my old high school classmates.

Edit: although there are a large number of guys I went to school with (and a few girls) I wouldn't mind saying "Fuck you!" to.I farted right in front of my boss and I started snapping my fingers in attempt to make it look like it was not a loud ass fart 

Edit: it was actually right in front of her face because she had knelt down behind me and I didn’t realize, so no way that I pulled it off. We never spoke of it. 

Edit 2: not necessarily related to my social anxiety, but no way in hell I’d ever admit to ripping ass in public. 

Edit 3: *heart eyes* my first Reddit Gold! It figures it would be about one of my fart stories. Thank you, beautiful and generous anonymous Redditor. <3When I was 8 or 9 I was at my cousins birthday party. At the end of the party every kid got a huge goodie bag filled with candy and toys to take home. So she sat on makeshift throne in the middle of the room, and every kid had to go up one by one and get a goodie bag from the princess. I noped the fuck out and snuck back to my dad's car.

On the ride home I was really regretting my decision tho, and hating myself for being so god damn awkward. So I started crying. That's when dad said he grabbed me a goodie bag before he left. He knew me so well.Tried to remind myself what date it is, while at the bar counter.

Got my beer.

She said "Thank you"

I said "Sixteenth".

Edit: Thanks for the gold, awkward stranger. I'm at the point where I rehearse my interactions before groceries get delivered to my door.Y-you tooWhen entering a public restroom, if there already happens to be somebody in there, I'll wash my hands uselessly until they leave. If somebody else walks in before or just as they leave, I generally decide I don't really need to be there and live that stomach- busting hell until I can find another restroom to start the process all over again. In middle school, I’d give lunch money to a friend and ask her to bring my tray to me so I didn’t have to walk through the lunch room. I’d also ask people to take my tray back for me once finished eating.
Even worse than that, in third grade I got super nervous when people would see me eat. I also had a fear of choking, so I’d only eat ketchup packets. I always loved ketchup and I guess it was a way to get some sort of salty flavor that reminded me of food without actually eating anything solid. People would give me their ketchup packets and I’d eat like ten or more at lunch time and that was it. If we had something good, I’d sneak it in my pocket and once back inside the classroom, I’d sneak it into my backpack and eat it at home that day. For some reason, my fear of choking was much smaller at home. 
I was an odd kid. Thankfully my social anxiety is a pretty small factor in my life now, although anything is small compared to that I guess lol. Talk on my cellphone when nobody is on the other end. I once stalked a guys social media accounts until I found the school his daughter went to so I could find a buzzbook/address book of that school that said his email address rather than taking 15 second to give him a call.  On a number he gave me. One time I was with my girlfriend my senior year of high school and we were just cuddling in my room and I got a really bad anxiety attack so I went to my bathroom and just sat in there and tried to calm down and I had to text my parents to go up to my room and tell my girlfriend to go home lol I felt so embarrassed... it was awful If I am exceptionally nervous about a social interaction or gathering I have agreed to attend, I will purposefully get hammered, let my phone die, travel to places just outside realistic return distances, and otherwise create a laundry list of realistic-sounding excuses why I couldn't make it. I feel myself doing it too, but the anxiety wins more than I do. Pathetic.... :,-/I get self conscious of the speed of my window wipers. I’m always comparing to other cars so I don’t look like I’m over doing itThere was a car full of 5 guys on the highway next to me. We were the only two cars on the road at the time, going the same speed. One of the guys in the back noticed me, then commented to the other guys to look over, too. So, they're talking and laughing and waving, pretending to clench their chests & whatnot ... I was so flustered by the attention that I didn't realize that I was sloowwlllyyyy drifting my car into their lane ... until I inadvertently ran them off the road. I'll never forget the looks on their faces, as they changed from amusement to sheer terror. It was part "is this a joke?" Then, "what the hell is she doing?" mixed with "oh my god we're gonna die ...". I couldn't stop it though; I was no longer in control, my shyness was. 

Another time, I was coming down the steps at my university, when a guy at the bottom of the stairs said loudly to his friend "hey isn't that the girl you're in love with from [our class]?!" So the guys are laughing and looking in my direction, drawing even more attention. I proceeded to turn bright red, get super nervous and ... fall down the concrete stairs. Every. Single. One. One time I was leaving a party and I turned my car right instead of left. To avoid looking like an idiot and turning around I just went with it and ended up in traffic for about 2 hours.
A girl told me: Hi, I’m Claire. My response: Hi, I’m Claire When I started high school, I used to hide behind a vending machine during lunch because I didn't know anyone. A few days later, I noticed someone else hiding behind the vending machine right across from me. We became friends shortly after.Ate two meals in a row. I was super hungry and had no self control so I ate a meal ~1 hour before I met up with friends for supper. Then I felt silly and didn't want to be the only one who didn't order food, so I forced a second meal down.I was in a grad school interview and I was scheduled to meet with a particular professor for 30 minutes. We ran out of things to talk about after about 20 minutes. I am not good at making eye contact, but confident people make a lot of eye contact, right? So I continued to make eye contact with the professor for about a minute with no words being said, constantly thinking "don't break eye contact, what should I say?, don't break eye contact, this is horrible" until I came up with something meaningless to say.A friend in High school had a crush on one of the librarians but was far too awkward to talk to them normally so he so would go  through the library and pick out books that he thought would impressive her. But once he got to the checkout counter he'd get  all choked up and shy and never get past a yeah. Just backed away from the register at McDonalds because I misjudged the cost.I awkward moon-walked back down the hallwayWas in a vitamin store with my cousins and I was thinking “we’re just browsing” and “we’re just perusing” and the guy working the store asked how we were doing and in total panic I like half screamed “we’re just bruising” with a giant smile on my face. He looked really uncomfortable and shuffled away. I haven’t gone back into that store since. Not me but something I saw today and see a lot in general on public transport.  
  
Guy gets on the bus, sees that every bench already has one person on it. Not a big deal, they're built for two people and while everyone likes their space, we also understand that it's an inevitability that when the bus gets full it's not a big deal to sit next to a stranger for 10 minutes. 
  
Not this guy. Walks the length of the bus to check for an empty, then returns to the middle doorway and chooses to stand there for the entire trip (40 minutes that I was on). Even when someone got off he slowly looked at the newly emptied bench but remained standing, glancing back at it every so often. 
  
I knew exactly what he's thinking. "Will people judge me for sitting down on my own now after standing for so long? Yeah, better stay standing so it looks intentional, like I want to be standing." NO YOU IDIOT, THAT'S WHAT'S MAKING ME JUDGE YOU. JUST SIT DOWN AND BE CONFORTABLE, LITERALLY NO ONE CARES. 
  
not even uncommon, I see similar behavior weekly.  
  
Edit: For the folks saying "But you cared, that's why we're anxious" - I only remembered this guy because he stuck to the awkward behaviour. If he'd just sat down like a normie I'd have already forgotten him. He created what he was anxious about... By being anxious about it. It's like a dog biting you because it can sense you're afraid of being bitten. I'll admit the reason I pick up on this behaviour is because I used to suffer from (regular) anxiety, but I recovered when I progressively realized that 9/10 times it was just me being in my own head causing the problems - nobody really gives a damn what I'm doing and 30 seconds after I leave everyone who saw me has already forgotten I existed.Oh, I've got one for this!

So first of all, you have to understand my anxiety is super bad. I've gotten much better in the last year, but I'm still not great now, so I was awful back when this happened, a few years ago.

I was visiting my gf in college for the weekend (her first year, I was a senior in high school). Anyways we'd been having fun that day, getting slurpies from the neighboring 7/11, other fun... (*wink*)

As the day went on though, she had class, and I elected to stay in her room and hang. Now, she had a single dorm, but how that works is there's this shared living room thing connecting several individual rooms, so you sorta halfway have roommates, and there's a shared, multi-toilet bathroom connected to the main room too. Anyway, sitting in the room for hours (her art class was really long), I eventually needed to pee. But all of the other occupants were hanging out and talking loudly in the main room. I was way too scared to go through them to the bathroom without my gf, as it felt awkward to have some rando walk through. I tried to wait, but it went on for two hours before I couldn't hold it. I freaked out and decided to pee into my empty slurpie cup, fill it with tissues so it couldn't spill out, put it by my gf's trash, and get rid of it later. That being said, I was beyond embarrassed and really upset, and in my freak out began to cry out of emotional overload and shame.

So eventually she comes back to find me on the floor, crying of shame, with a slurpie cup full of tissues and pee. Luckily she gets it and felt super bad for me, cause she's the greatest.

TLDR; staying in gf's dorm, too afraid to walk through people to the bathroom so I peed in a slurpies cup and cried about it until she came home.Throwaway time!

I had Asperger's when I was a kid. I guess I still have it, but it's barely noticeable now. It was bad back then. Along with the Asperger's came very strong social anxiety. 

The school I was at didn't quite know what to do with me, because I could do the work well, but I was being bullied badly. So they decided to send me on what we called work experience. I'm not sure if this is a thing these days, or if it ever was in the USA (I'm from another country). It's a couple of weeks in a year where, instead of going to school, you do what's basically a short internship somewhere. It's to give you a taste for how the world works after school. They sent me off for work experience for what ended up being three months. They just kept sending me back out to different stores once I'd completed the weeks at one place. 

Anyway, at the first place I was too anxious to ask to go to the bathroom until I was in pain from not going. By that point I'd pissed myself a little. Once the wet spot got larger than about an inch or two across the front of my pants I'd ask to go. But before then I'd duck down between the aisles of this electronics store and check. I'd examine my crotch, feel the wetness, and sometimes even smell it (I don't know why). 

One day the manager called me into his office. He chatted with me for a bit. Then he pointed to the CCTV screens above his desk. 

"See those? Pretty cool, hey? On these I can see *everything that goes on in my store*. Anyway, catch you later. See me if you need anything."

Guess what? It wasn't until years later that I realized he was subtly explaining that he could see me checking my pants every day. I mean, subtle social interactions weren't exactly my strong point. Programming computers was, but that wasn't much help here. Pretty cringey moment when I realized he could see me the whole time and, not only that, but after he nicely tried to tell me this, I just kept doing what I was doing. I'm someone who suffers from severe social anxiety/phobia so a lot of things I consider normal would probably be considered weird to most.    Just off the top of my head.....I don't take my trash outside or check my mail until very late at night or early mornings due to the fear of my neighbors being outside.   Same goes for taking my dogs for walks, I have a special route I take that after a lot of trial and error results in the least populated areas.    When I go to the store I will wait until an aisle has nobody in it before I get what I need.  Overall I simply will go way out of my way to avoid any social interaction even if I could get something done twice as fast by interacting.     Such is my lifeI don't know if it was caused by social anxiety. But I remember being 8 years old at a big family dinner and I kept farting uncontrollably whenever someone said something funny. I probably did it a total of 5 times and the table would just be quiet and look at me whenever I'd do it. To this day I still cringe thinking about it. I used to have crippling social anxiety; to the point where even interacting with a cashier would make me nervous. It's much better now, but I do remember there were many instances where i've said some pretty awkward things or showed improper body language. For example, in college, I was sitting in the common office area for my job as a TA at the time. I saw one of my coworkers talking to his friend. For whatever reason, I thought the proper way to get his attention was to rudely interrupt their conversation by screaming across the room and saying to his friend "Hey you! stop talking". I did the stop sign hand gesture to her. And then I proceeded to ask my coworker a question, all with an awkward cocky smile and everything. They both looked so confused, but my coworker decided to answer my question instead of calling me out for being rude. *phew*. I even knew at the time, what I did was awkward, but I just didn't know how to express myself, and even my body language was wrong. Luckily i've grown a lot since then and I don't do weird things like that anymore; i'm mostly functional in social settings. Took the stairs cause I wasn’t in the mood to interact with humans on the elevator I just purchased a new Nest thermostat after mine suffered a rare issue where the network chip stopped working even though that was covered under warranty. Because that would have required me to call them and have a lengthy conversationIn art class at school I was too nervous to ask someone if I could squeeze past so I went around the table, which was a very tight squeeze against the wall. I accidently knocked over a cup of paint water onto someone's painting, ruining it. They had spent weeks on it. Can't say it helped my anxiety when he yelled at me! I can't swallow if anyone is sitting remotely near me.I skipped my 7th birthday party entirely, by hiding in various places so my parents couldn't find me for long enough to make me attend. It was at our house.

Forward 20 years later; 
Despite sometimes crippling anxiety, I love dealing with the public and work as a waitress to help force myself to be able to lead a semi normal life. Each customer interaction is a hoot and often leads to stumbling over words and saying stupid shit. *Brings out plates, studders while repeating back the order*  "I can't say what you ordered, but I hope you enjoy it." Guests usually just laugh.At a conference in San Francisco, there was a social reception thing for all the attendees. Everyone was drinking beer and other things, seemed like everyone had someone to talk to.

I didn't feel like drinking to fit in, but someone actually came up to me to make small talk. I raised my cellphone and tried to drink from it. Like it was a beer.I’ve avoided socialization so much that I have a maxed clash of clans account from staring at my phone in group situations  I was at a social event and the girl that I like was leaving. So I got up to hug her. But, I backed out and collapsed on a table and started crying out of nowhere. It was very humiliating.Once I had to go to my bank to tell them I was gonna be out of the country and do some other account-related things. On the way out the reception dude said "Have a great trip!" And I said "you too!"
I took like three steps before I realized that was dumb and turned around to say something that actually made sense, but I freaked out and didn't say anything, we just stared at each other for like 5 seconds. Then he just smiled and said "It's ok bro." 
I left.Walked 2 miles home rather than ask for a ride.One time, after smoking copious amounts of the devil's lettuce, I went to go buy some nachos at a local Mexican fast food place.  It was a Thursday night, so it was slow, and I walked right to the counter.  The 2 ladies working started talking in Spanish and laughing, so at this point I start getting nervous.  I start to order, and they keep talking and giggling, and now all I can think about is what they're saying about me.  Then, one of them asks me what kind of beans I'd like, and without thinking, I blurted out "steak".  It was pretty much a shit show for the rest of the order.I quit karate after 2 years because a requirement to earn my black belt was to do a weapons routine in front of the entire school.Bunch of kids were having get togethers after we graduated 8th grade. I wasn't friends with everyone but I got invited to like 3 different parties. I lived within walking distance of them all. I got a ride from my dad to the first one, he dropped me off outside, waited for me to walk in the front door then he drove off. Once I got inside I didn't see any of my friends or people I actually talked to, thankfully nobody noticed I got there so I just walked back out and started walki n to the other party. It was about 5 blocks away. As I get close to the house I was like "I probably don't know anyone there either" so I turned around and started walking to the last party I was invited to.

As I am walking down the block of the last party I could hear people talking in the backyard but I couldn't recognize any voices. I paced up and down the block a couple times to try and hear a familiar voice. I didn't.

I walked to a park close to my house and climbed a tree and just sat there thinking about all the fun I could be having. I waited in the tree for a while, long enough to make it seem like I was actually out at these parties. Climbed down then walked home and told my parents I had a good time, then went and played Starcraft for like 5 hours.I had just changed schools when I was 13 and was trying to make new friends. We were all sitting at the lunch table when this girl named Autumn sat down with a salad and the dressing was really weird looking. I loudly told her "Melted, that looks like Autumn cheese." Everyone looked at me like what the hell did you just say? I tend to spoonerize a lot when I get nervous. I mix up whole words or just several letters in each word. Keeps things interesting and now I've done it during work meetings. It's also hard to form coherent sentences. I also used to cry while giving book reports in front of the class.  Gotta love social anxiety. My boss invited me to a party at her friend's massive house. I'm 21 year-old female; everyone else was in their late 30's or older, and most people came with children. Quickly realizing that I had very little in common with these people, I drank about five glasses of wine as fast as I could without making it obvious.

Decently hammered, I decided that I'd rather play outside with these people's three year-olds than have to pretend to be interested in what the adults have to say. After about 20 minutes of playing, the kids started rolling around in the grass. Wine glass in hand, I joined them without considering what might go wrong. Obviously, the glass fucking shattered under my weight.

Too socially anxious to go inside looking for a recycling bin and make it obvious that I was the first one that night to break a glass (my boss broke two a couple of hours later) I decided to hide the glass in a nearby bush and get it at the end of the party when people would be cleaning up. The end of the night came, and of course I forgot about the fucking broken wine glass in the bush. 

I still occasionally see the woman who hosted this party and it makes me nervous because she never addresses me or says hi, and I don't know if she knows about the glass or if she just thought I was a total weirdo for hanging out with a bunch of little kids. I once asked a girl out to coffee and she said "I don't think my boyfriend would like that" to which I immediately responded "I don't think mine would either." I was single and I'm straight. Good job me.Oh god.. this still haunts me. I worked retail and got better at talking to people, but still had major anxiety. If it got too bad, I'd ask to go out for a smoke break, which my manager was very cool with. I mainly am just very awkward with small talk. A lot of my job was helping customers, talking to people that seemed lonely or needed it, and just being kind. I loved helping people and actually had customers ask about me frequently, which always made my day. They'd even give me gifts on holidays.. I fucking loved our regulars. 

But anyway, one slow day, I started talking myself up in my head. I wanted to try to improve my small talk and be nice. I had skimmed through the news paper earlier and saw one of our regulars had died. It didn't say the reason why he passed, but he'd always been very sweet to me, so I was genuinely sad. I'd already had a few customers bring it up, since everyone knew it, but one woman... was insanely rude about the deceased. She told me what a horrible person he was, that he'd died of syphilis from cheating on his wife. People can be rude, so I just brushed it off.

So, fast forward a few hours and this sweet, but quiet, little older lady comes in. I try to strike up a conversation about the weather, but she's not very receptive, so I start feeling my anxiety hit. I still don't know why... but I brought up the death I read in the newspaper. The conversations from earlier popped into my head. Anxiety, stupidity, and word vomit.. I don't know. She gave me this look which, for whatever fucking reason, made me stutter out, "Yeah, I heard he died of syphilis from cheating on his wife.. Terrible way to go." Just anxious word vomit spilling from my mouth.

God, i instantly wanted to bash my head against the register repeatedly. Why the fuck did I just spout that bullshit rumor? But before I could even apologize or react.. She tears up. I freeze. Fuck. I felt ice cold panic bubbling up. She starts sobbing and screams, "Fuck everyone in this town! My husband was a good man. It was brain cancer! Fucking brain cancer!!!" My heart was pounding, a full blown panic attack coming on, and I couldn't physically make myself say anything. Couldn't apologize or explain. I just stared in shock. She storms out, and I went and hid in the bathroom and cried for thirty minutes.

Out of everyone in my town of 6000 fucking people, I managed to find and talk shit about the deceased to his goddamn widow out of  anxiety.. The ONE time I try to direct conversation. I still feel sick thinking about it. I'm a terrible person and have never tried to make small talk again.

TL;DR: Read one of my regular customers died. Tried to make small talk to improve my social skills. Ended up spouting a stupid rumor to his widow about him dying of syphilis. She had a breakdown and I cried in the bathroom.It was at work a lil over a year ago. My boss was asking me how I liked working on the floor compared to the office. I mixed up the phrases, I get to spread my wings with something about stretching my legs.....this came out of my mouth, 
"I like getting out on the floor and spreading my legs." 
We still laugh about it at work :/Curled up in a ball in the corner of the dance floor hyperventilating until someone from my friend group showed up and took me home.-At doc appointment
-Nurse says, "How's school going?"
-I say, "It's going well. I have a test tomorrow."
-Nurse: "Well, good luck!" Then she turns to walk away."
-Me: "Same to you."
-Nurse: "..."
-Me: "..."There’s tons of stuff I’ve done, but I can’t recall because I’ve mentally blocked it out for my sanity.I had the same dance improv day too and I was so anxious about coming up with something when it was my turn I clapped a few times, turned in a circle, and did the grapevine and then ran out because "I really had to pee"To be fair, Stacy’s mom did have it going on.But did she say yes?Hey man sounds like you had a good time 
The  “oh, excuse me” tactic is the smartest move I’ve ever heard of. Why have I not thought of this? Wow...This one is masterfulI just wait in the stall till everybody leaves. Then I get unfairly annoyed when people take a long time.I admire the commitment. Bravo!This is amazing to me because what could you have possibly needed from your trunk that would justify you leaving a child at school after 40 minutes of waiting in line? HahahahaLike an exaggerated version of the old "look at your phone and frown before turning round when you realise you've gone the wrong way" trickThat's the problem with Arsenal; they always walk it in. https://youtu.be/45jm32SZ798

Edit: Wow, my first gold! Thanks!"You were saying football things in a football voice!", to quote a classic.


EDIT: "things", not "stuff"I pretended for the longest time I was allergic to coconut. You will have a breaking point and it will be a weird one. Can relate. I tried breaking my fingers in 6th grade because I didn't want to play my clarinet in front of my band class."Pizza upon you"Papal JohnsThat's smooth as fuck. You probably blew her mind. She has no response. There is no win or lose. Just time passing.zenyatta is that you?One of the few situations where "you too" is actually a correct response.I have to apologize to you, so I’m sorry.  I don’t want to take your situation too lightly, but your “Pizza Pope”  made laugh out loud.  I really liked the “peace be upon you” as well. Working as a server at a Bennigans in the 1980's, I asked my table if they would like desert. They said no, that they were full. I humorously asked if I could roll them out of there. They looked at me in confused silence. I retreated to the back of the house. Minutes later I returned to another table in my station to watch in horror when the "desert" people pulled a folding wheel chair out to help a paraplegic member of their table out of the restaurant and "roll her out".  I’ve gotten off at the wrong stop because I didn’t want to tell the driver I didn’t mean this one...Honestly, that's a really solid gaming jokeRespectableI'm just imagining you having a Vietnam flashback, but instead of soldiers screaming, it's the echoed sounds of a violent shit. There was a time when I would hide whenever someone unexpectedly knocked on the door. Sometimes I would literally be lying on the floor behind the couch trying not to breathe too loud in case they could hear me. I still hide occasionally, I hate people turning up without calling first.
Edit: yay for all the upvotes! Boo that they're because I'm pathetic.
Edit 2: I'm glad I'm not alone, but sorry so many others feel the need to hide. Luckily this is rare for me now, but my heart races every time I hear the doorbell unexpectedly. Of course that could partly be because it plays the Lone Ranger theme at a gazillion decibels and scares the crap out of me every time (my partner got sick of missing parcels).ohnoSee the problem is there are small packets of air between each poop bundle. This leads to that sputtering guttural sound when the excrement evacuates the anus hole. 

I don't think we listen too carefully to these apoostics when we drop anchor, but with others it is very noticeable. I️ mean you were!It's surprising how comfortable the car is when you're outside of a social event. I don't even want to know the amount of hours I've wasted trying to work up the courage to go in. I would struggle a bit with people in my peer group who I was only really acquaintances with rather than friends, back in my teens.

A lot of people went for food at an Italian restaurant in my home town and I ordered pizza. Not only was I too awkward to cut the pizza into slices and eat it with my hands but I, like yourself, came to a moment where I was choking on food - the meat was very fatty - and refused to let anyone know that I was choking. 

That first breath when the food stuck in your throat finally dislodges is probably one of life’s sweetest.A lot of people who choked to death choked to death in bathrooms for the same reason. They get embarrassed and sneak off to the bathroom instead of asking for help.Actually common for people choking. Some people get up and leave a room with people and then promptly choke to death. Reminds me of my little sisters engagement party. Not normally socially anxious but was going through a rough time and couldn't deal with a house full of people I didn't know. It was at my now brother in laws parents house and most of guests were on his families side.

First person I spoke to I stuck my hand out and said "Hi, I am Vicky's sister" (I am male). Got flustered and tried to backtrack by saying "...erm I mean sibling... I'm a relative" *FUUUCCCK. GET A GRIP YOU PRICK*

Because I'd made the mistake and got flustered. I repeated it about four times that afternoon topping it off my saying "I'm Vicky' s sister..." *shit* "...I mean she is my brother"I am (old enough to be) your father's brother's nephew's cousin's former roommate!


Edit: I didn't expect my most up voted comment to be about Space Balls...I've been to Bonefish with my buddy. At one point the waitress comes up and says "Hey guys. How are you? How's everything? " and my friend said "WE'RE DELICIOUS " very loudly. We got a new waitress. So many Awkward serving moments 

Once asked a table if they wanted a refill on their Poopsie?  .. just walked away ..

Also asked if they needed “more minutes” .."What's your name?"

"I DIDN'T KNOW THERE'D BE A TEST!!"I was taking an oral Korean exam and my professor asked  my name, I just stared at her with a look of horror because at that moment I forgot my name. She asked again in English and It took about a minute of silence for me to remember my name. Got a 95 at least. I work in retail and an older lady came through my line. She opted to sign up for our rewards card, so I had to take her information. 

I asked her for her name and she stood there and thought about it for a full minute before slamming her hand on the counter and practically screamed "GLENDA! I'm the good witch." 

I laughed so hard I had tears running down my face. I thought I would offend the lady, but when I finally controlled myself, she was laughing just as hard. They don't even have sizes, this is amazing on so many levels. Are you ok my guy?First one to make me laugh. The others all made me smirk or cringe a little. Full on snort laughed.

"YES, WELCOME!" 

God bless you.This one actually physically hurt to read. I'm so sorry.The key to getting out of social awkwardness is realizing that nobody cares about you.

You still remember this moment 15 years later, but I guarantee those people forgot about you 10 minutes after leaving and never thought about you again. How well do you remember when other people do something awkward? This one had me laughing out loud. Hopefully you're able to somewhat see the humour in it now. 

I have moments that haunt me, but they also make funny stories to tell!That's fucked up.That poor woman was trying to be helpful while also being super bewildered. Aww"I uh.... I'm not looking for you"

Oh ok.

Edit: my highest comment ever is this.....This actually made me laugh so hard I cried.
Been there just a couple days ago. Thought I saw an old co-worker from a trucking company I quit 7 months ago. Got face to face in the dark before I realized it wasn't him. Ended up asking his name and how long he's been there, talked some shit about the company, and walked away. So much for leaving on good terms.So did she go get you? i relate to this hardMy name is B.E.N. I spell it Ben.I used to work at Chick-fil-A and some guy came in and said his name was Bo and proceeded to spell it out for me. “My name is Bo...B-O”. And I promptly spelled his name back out for him and said “ok B-O. You have a great day” I still think about that encounter 

Edit: I’d like to add another experience I just remembered. Some guy came through the drive through and he asked that his two meals be put in separate bags. I told my bagger and all was well until I handed him his food. He asked me “which bag was which” in regards to the meals. Except I didn’t hear him the first time...or the second...or the third...or the fourth time. Finally on the fifth try he yelled at me “WHICH BAG IS WHICH!?”. Of course at this point I had forgotten and proceeded to tell him I didn’t know and he angrily sped off into the night. I saw him a few times after that but he never seemed to remember. 
 Come to England where it's near enough an unwritten rule that *nobody* speaks in an elevator.I pause my music in enclosed spaces because I'm afraid I'm breathing loudly/weirdly or something.I've finally found someone who understands this problem. I thought I was only who felt this way. The worse part about it is if your trying to be serious, people usually think you're lying, because you can't look them in the eye when trying to tell the truth. RIPI work at a hardware store and sell LED light bulbs.  I tell people they have a 20 year life on them, and many old people respond, "Oh, I'm not gonna live that long, no need to bother with that!"

A couple times I've slipped and said things like "yeah, you're probably right!"Oh my god I also work in retail and Im so bad at it when customers make jokes like that, I try and just laugh along but yaknow I don't want to agree and make them feel bad and aaaaa never know what to say in those situations haha

Edit: y'all are full of advice, unneeded but thanksI have social anxiety but i think the bedroom instinct would overpower it and rather act all over confident asking if I could join in or I'd tell them to fuck off I hate that I relate to this.“Oh shit there she is, god she’s hot. Okay, just like you practiced...left, right, left, right, FUCK you’re waddling, she’s gonna think you’re bow legged, FUCK am I bow legged?!”Anytime I walk in front of a group of people or feel like in being watched when walking.

"System Panic. - Must reboot. Manual mode activated. "HAHAHAHAHAHHAA that's a good description! I do know that feelEven worse: takes several of the same turns as cute girl I'm walking *behind*. She must think I'm a stalker.Body starts playing QWOPOh god I hate the fucking phone. No matter what I end up talking over the other person. And when I have to make “cold” calls for information or whatever I always feel like I’m bothering whoever is on the other end.

I also hate making what I consider non-standard calls and there extreme awkwardness that results, for instance having to call a Subway restaurant and asking if I can get a hold of security cam footage from the 15th of October.Fellow phone hater. 

I have been with my wife for 12 years. She knows every bit of my anxieties. I still leave the room to make/take calls if she or anyone else is around. 

I'm sure it looks shady as hell but making a call is hard enough without an inactive 3rd party listening to the whole thing. When I was a bank teller I had a nice conversation with an older customer. Afterwards she said thanked me and told me she loved me.

#AutoGrandmaThis reminds me of one of mine. 

Boyfriend - "Jess, this is my mom"

Mom - "Hi Jess!"

Me - "Hi Mom!"

A part of me died that day. I used to pretend I wasn’t home when my now-ex’s mom came around. She was a trainwreck of a person, always high, always needy, always complaining, and she would walk around the entire house and look through the windows and bang on them. I would hide in a closet or under a pile of blankets while holding very still. Anything to avoid dealing with her one-on-one.

Her drug habits wouldn’t have bothered me as much if she didn’t spend all her money on drugs and then whine about not being able to buy groceries or pay her bills.Had to drop something off for my daughter last night at my exs apartment and half-ass formally met his girlfriend. She was under a pile of blankets and as I was leaving I didn't know what to say so my brain panicked and I said "Goodbye blanket lady". 

Immediately wanted to throw myself down the stairs after I closed the door.  😐"Hi"

"Me too thanks"I once dated someone for a year in middle school too early high school. I said their name a total of zero times to anyone including her.Hotel public guest bathrooms are great for home-away-from-home usage. Just walk past the lobby acting like you belong there. They're usually clean and typically pretty vacant, unlike restaurants.

No need for bushes.I’ve done something similar to this. I hate that. I feel like I’m not normal for feeling that. But thankfully I have a bathroom in my room now and I no longer have to face that Too many of these answers are just like "I felt awkward at a cash register and said something dumb lol". Was looking for this one... Been there man. Was in a fraternity (terrible place for people with social anxiety) and whenever there were too many people over I'd get afraid to leave my room and turned to the ole empty water bottle a time or five. Doing better now though ha ha...a teacher noticed that i didn't have any friends in lunch and so she had me sort the teacher's mail in the office everyday instead of going to lunchOhhh my god in 11th grade on light days I had no friends in that lunch and I’d do exactly the same- or I’d just go to my band director 

EDIT: my school colors were Green and Gold so I’d have different lunch times and different classes on each day. Light days = Gold Days :) and on dark days I’d eat with friends.You literally just described my lunch periods throughout high schoolI did the exact same thing for my final two years of high school, although I would sometimes spend break awkwardly standing at the edge of a group, not saying anything for 30 minutes. That was when I was feeling social. 

If not, I would tour the school, staying in each bathroom for a couple of minutes - if someone was there, I would pretend to use the urinal for like a minute and then leave again. I used to hate it. I sometimes wonder if anyone knew - surely someone, a teacher maybe, noticed the same kid pass them at roughly the same time each day. Who knows? Just glad I'm passed it. This was me my entire senior year of high school. I had a study during lunch block so I️ could technically choose which lunch I️ went to but most days I’d just end up spending the entire block in the library because I️ didn’t ever commit to one lunch block or friend. And then eventually I️ didn’t go because I️ didn’t want to have to admit to anyone that I’d spent the entire year of lunches in the library.

Oh how I️ don’t miss high school.I still do the same thing otherwise I start ramblingOnce, my friend was leaving my house, and I said the line from Elf where the narwhal says "bye Buddy, hope you find your dad!" And I remembered that his dad ^left ^^when ^^^he ^^^^was ^^^^^7My solution is to arrive at the party before anyone else does and get hammered. That way my social anxiety is far gone before anyone shows up.I hear that buddy. I’ve waited in my car for so long for someone I know to turn up just so I can get out and pretend I just got there. 

“Hey man you just arrive? Me too”
I legit cannot go anywhere social without someone I know. It sorta seems clingyI relate to this so hard Ahh, my first class on my first day of college.  I was late, and when I pulled open the door to go in, everyone (seems like) in the auditorium turned around to look at me. I just opened my hand and let the door swing back closed. Could not make myself go in.I dropped out of a class when I was in college because I kept doing the same thing. 😔I have a system in place if I need to turn around. First, I pull out my phone and turn it on, I raise my eyebrows and I walk to the side of the hallway next to the lockers and look at my phone is surprise, I smile and look up the direction I'm going in and start speed walking. Am I overthinking it? Yes. Does it look stupid? Oh definitely. Do I still do it? Every time.

Edit: Hi. Yes, I'm fully aware nobody cares if I turn around. I'm fully aware I'm not the only person in the world with their minds too occupied to care about things like that. It makes me feel less anxious, even though I'm completely aware it looks more obnoxious than just turning around. You can stop telling me all of this now. TIL creepy hiders in bushes just have social anxiety. When you don't want to seem creepy, but it makes you act creepyYou, my friend, may have just started the next Reddit trend. 

👉😎👉 zoop!👉😎👉





Zoop 

Edit: what have I done For some reason this one made me laugh the hardest. Fucking zoopThis is so relatable it hurts
zip it up and zip it out!I feel like zoop will be a thing on Reddit now I never know what to do in a situation where I open a door to go in/out and someone is on the other side. So, the obvious solution that I take is to make a higher pitched whoop noise.  I think it's an attempt to lighten the mood. Not sure, but it never works and I keep doing it. 

Also when walking past people in a crowded area. I say excuse me, and if they don't pay attention, or move, I do a similar sound and extend the whoop until I get past. 

Edit; I also have picked up finger guns as a joke, but do it somewhat seriously now...👉👉 bingo bongoI related with the whole "thought about it the whole way home". I would much rather a zoop and fingerguns than  the awkward laugh and half wave coupled with a "well I guess I'll see ya later". You're doing a great job.I always listen for people before i leave my room, sometimes I just don't wanna have to talk to anybody I've done the same, but my roommate was my brother.Some nights I don't eat because of this. I end up falling asleep waiting for the people to leave...This is so comforting to read. Glad I'm not the only one with roommate social anxiety. Counting down the days until I can get my own place...You must have been a cat in your past life.This made me laugh. Cheers.no one asked me to the school danceIf a girl asked me to a school dance I would only assume it was part of a trick to humilate me.

Edit: i see a depressing number of people were pranked by the "pretending to like you" trick.Instead of going to my senior prom me and an equally socially anxious girl stayed at my place watching anime and playing video games. Hell, I used to hold it or actually drive home during free blocks lolIt always a instant reaction that I immediately regretUgh, too real. I usually can manage a smile, get a smile back.. and then immediately look away..

Like what are you supposed to do?? Just walk up like Joey Tribiani??* Hey, how *you* doin'?"

\*vomits on shoes*This happens to me with group interviews. I have no problem talking one on one with somebody but I struggle when it’s a large group Found out I had to do one of these and stopped at a music store to buy a harmonica. 

Never played a harmonica in my life.

My technique was so bad on top of having nervous, shaky breath that I ended up playing mostly high-pitched or flat notes that had absolutely no flow.

After I was done, they looked at me expectantly and I was just like 'heh, heh that's it...' and they gave me the saddest round of pity applause ever. I still think about this moment while laying awake at night and cringe. 

Got the job tho ayyy 

Did your friend forget about you?Oh, this is classic. I thought I was the only one who would order two drinks when getting takeout so they didn’t think (well, KNOW) that all that food was for me. That, or say, “I’ll have the orange chicken, and then he wants walnut shrimp.” I went to Overeaters Anonymous once, and just hearing that others did the extra-drink trick was enough to make me weep with relief!Protip: If you want to make it more believable, have them put wax paper in between the bread and the meat/veggies on one of the sandwiches. 

Tell them "It's for tomorrow, I don't want the bread to get soggy in the fridge."I crawl up the stairs to my bedroom, which has a view of the door so I can peep out the blinds until I know they are gone. It's only ever salesmen anyways.

Edit: I'm 32.>"I know"

that's just the best.She turned around and was just like "?"jesus christ dude/r/IDontWorkHereLadyHad a similar thing happen to me cute saleswoman trying to sell me nail products.  She starts with a hand massage and her sales pitch I waited till she was done(20 mins and both hands massaged) then finally just said I was broke and walked away.   Embarrassing as shit but at least I got a hand massageThis makes sense though. Those people sucked.I would be so confused if i saw someone randomly snapping their fingers and farting lolThis is my favorite one.In middle school I once farted while my entire class was getting yelled at by the head master for something or other we were all guilty of. Was clenching my buttcheeks as tight as I possibly could but there was just no holding it back apparently. There was this awkward silence.... amazingly NO ONE laughed because it was in the middle of a chewing out but internally it was hilarious for all I think.One time in middle school I went to a talent show with some friends. One of the acts was a girl dancing, and she wasn't very good at it. Toward the end of the act I felt a fart coming on that I couldn't stop, so I figured I'd let it out as slowly as I could in an effort to conceal it. All the chairs in the room were hard with no cushions, so it was the exact opposite of quiet. I did succeed in letting it out slowly, though, and apparently someone in the crowd mistook it for a slow clap and followed suit. Then more. This led to a literal standing ovation while I had to do all I could to not burst out in laughter. The girl won third place.Haha Good DadAww. It's kind of like how when they sing happy birthday and you have that kind of "ehhghghhhhhggg" feelingawww...what a sweet dad!That sums up my childhood.  I finally started getting treatment for it well into my 30's.  So many things could've been different in my life if my parents would've paid more attention. I started seeing signs of it in my son at a real early age and we started getting him help around age 7. It's amazing at the differences I can see in his thought processes and actions.  that happened to me while counting money at work.

Customer: Hello

Me: *nods* eleven.“It’s 10:33”This one made me laugh out loud. I wonder if the bartender thought you were on your sixteenth beer. Life is so much better with grocery delivery though. Much better than walking as fast as you can through the store with your head down.I do that a lot at movie theaters when I'm buying a ticket.
"Enjoy your movie"
"You to"
I take about 10 steps before I realize I'm a dumbassI'll normally go sit in a stall and wait for the other person to leave. There have been multiple times where I'm sitting there quietly, and the other person sits there quietly...and we just sit there waiting until one of us leaves.When I was in 2nd or 3rd grade I was literally choking, couldnt breathe, in the cafeteria. I was so embarrassed I pretended not to he choking. Eventually (felt like forever, I'm sure it wasnt) a teacher came up talking to me about something unrelated, quickly realized I was choking when I didnt respond, and gave me some odd heimlich. I think my social anxiety over my friends knowing I was choking almost killed me lolis that [you](https://i.redditmedia.com/l-3ggfArj_YTFeS4hpf9duQLX9K3hkb_JZWEWNGBWOk.jpg?w=750&s=e4e1353a637fa31ab3873aae57405e64)? 
Well this is just creepy dawgAs someone who avoids talking on the telephone if there's any possible way out of it, I completely understand and would have done the same. You know you can just lie, right?Hey everybody look, this guy's windshield wipers are going to fast! He's got 'em up on medium-high, when we all know this level of rain requires them to be on low to low-medium at best!I'm actually sitting here, in disbelief that other people do this. I don't care what speed other people's wipers are going, why do I think people are looking at mine? Literally spend every rainy day convincing myself how ridiculous I'm being, but it's no use it's completely subconscious.You’re not alone. Caught myself doing this on my way to work this morning.So in the end, you fell for him huhI don't know why this made me laugh so. Accidental dominant assertion. Yeah... that's right... I ran them off the road rather than have to interact or ignore them from across the road. Bahaha.I double booked myself for lunch with two of my friends. Instead of cancelling one I went to both and ate two lunches and didn't mention it.I had something a little different. My friends brought me out to dinner once. It was nice of them to pay for my meal except I was the only one eating.I do this. I figure, "hey, I'm uncomfortable, might as well make them uncomfortable by looking them straight in the eyes nonstop."That’s... actually kind of adorable Sometimes I legit prefer standing if I have a long day where I don't get away from my desk much. Then again I don't glance at empty seats on those days.Yep, I've been there. This is me , and I like seeing other people do similar things because it makes me realize it's not that big of a deal either way Man.I️ justify it as “exercise”Are you also very conscious of how loud it is when you swallow? I find it especially difficult to drink anything, which seems louder to me.Wow, that took a steep dive This one is super sad, but totally understandable. Have you been able to go back, or do you think this might be the end of your training forever? [Your friend should've got down with you and pretended it was the new dance.](https://youtu.be/3Dit-z1O0Qw?t=49)  

But in all honesty, good to have friends.  Are you better with things now? Might use your voice acting skills to add a little washroom small talk in the mix.He’s like the James Bond of social anxiety!But then they’ll think you’re taking a poop!"I WILL SLIT YOUR FUCKING THROAT..."

*gets back in car and drives away*You know I like to think of myself as an entire experience "Pizza pon you."Experience pepperoni.Except you have to be fancy, so it'd be more like, "And you as well."Simple solution: as you step off the bus, put on a fake moustache, then get on the bus pretending to be someone entirely different.Well to be fair there *was* the sound of anguish and pain. Just from poops and not from actual war...My exact thought when I heard that it was him and that he was sitting down. Sitting down means poopin' time. I hate when it's one person you know inviting you to a party of everyone else you don't know. It's like, if they leave you, you're just completely alone with strangers.Yes people need to know this, not just kids grown add adultsFuck that's terrifying...I had done that a few times because I was too embarrassed to ask other people for help.Fretting about repeating a mistake so much that you constantly repeat it is the worst.Ah man, this one put me in tears.3am and I'm cracking up in my room alone at this trying not to wake the baby with my incessant giggling. This one wins. The best one for me was going up the cashier to pay on my way home after my shift 

Her: How are you?

Me: Oh fine, are you ready to order or do you need a minute?

Her:... *breaks down laughing* 

Me: Oh No!

Guy behind me: I did the same with a phone salesman yesterday!

It was like a daisy chain of fucked up service people after long shifts.  "What's your name?"

"March tenth, nineteen ninety five.  Wait, ninety four!"My high school chemistry class once did so badly on a quiz, our teacher offered us a point for correctly spelled names. 
 
 
I'd left the last letter off my surname. **WE THREW OUT HIS NAME**Yes just weird I'll take it to go pleaseI read this story and thought same thing- doubt they even gave it any thought about it. It would be super interesting to hear their perspective of the events and compare the two. 
My guess is they moved on in a split second and didn’t think about you. No offense. 



I suffer from social anxiety and used to suffer so much more, like to the point where I puked in the street once because I was so scared. This is the one thing that has really truly helped me. Social anxiety makes you the center of the world and is a bit narcissistic in that way, but people are self-centered and truly don't care about what you do, and that's a good thing. 

I've also gotten so much better with strangers in general because even if I do something stupid that I wake up in a sweat about 10 years later, that person doesn't know me and I probably won't see them again, so even if they are telling that story of when I fell on the treadmill while it was still running and scraped my palms and knees to hell, it doesn't affect me. But they probably aren't telling people because after a day or two it doesn't matter anymore. 

It's made it so much easier and sort of freed me from a prison of my brain. Even without all the dumb (but totally normal) things people did in this post, social anxiety always made me feel stiffer, made it difficult to smile (I never knew why?) and overall just made me seem weirder, which was obviously off putting to people.

I still struggle in that awkward phase of kind of knowing someone but not being close to them because I can't just think they don't care or I'll never see them again, but it's a work in progress.

Also, if you just go somewhere in the public with a lot of people and observe, you will see people do all kinds of dumb stuff and it's really nothing. Like it might feel awkward to realize you're going the wrong way so you stop abruptly and turn around, but the first time I noticed someone doing that, it was kind of freeing. They didn't look like some crazy weirdo, they were just a person who realized they were going the wrong way. 

Edit: I know everyone hates the thanks for the gold edits, but thanks for the gold stranger! It's my first! It's also makes me feel good that it was on this because it maybe makes me feel like I'm working in the right direction. "Your skin wouldn't fit."She caught up to me. She's a great sister. It went like this: Hey! Hi! What's up! Nice to see you! Howdy! Hey bro! Oh my god! You're back! Hi! Hey! What's up! Back Door. Down the alley. Dive bar a block away. Sitting by myself. Or come to Minnesota where it's weird if you don't say something to a stranger in the elevator[deleted]Yeah exactly that. Looking back now, that might be one of the reasons why I rarely go beyond the first date with girls. My eyes wander too much and they might think they are boring me or that I'm a douche...What you need to say is "You'll never have to change the bulb again then!"Yeah just laugh then go back to your standard interaction script and wait for time to pass.Yep, there is one thing that always overpowers anxiety and that is anger. Without a second thought I would tell them to hop right the fuck out of my room. My room is mine, get the fuck out.I do this all the time. I worry about if I am walking weird or not, and then end up walking weird to avoid walking weird... You are being seen, but most likely not watched. Unless you're walking like [this](https://youtu.be/iV2ViNJFZC8) nobody pays any more attention than just object avoidance/spacial awareness.Same. There was this girl that started walking in front of me while I started walking and I turned into a Starbucks just to stop accidentally following her. What happened on the 15th? Hmmm? HMMM!?Roll out!I end every phone call with my family, boyfriend and close friends with "Bye, love you!" and very rarely make any other phonecalls due to anxiety. Had to phone up the tax office recently, and I of course ended it with "Thank you, love you!" and immidiately hung up when I realised.This could be easily played off as a joke. Thats actually hilarious lol.Well to be fair your boyfriend didn't introduce her real name. Lol You - "hi mom!" 

Mom "welcome to the family daughter in law"I did this on purpose multiple times entirely as a joke. When played off correctly it really helps start out on the right foot with the parents.Sounds like you actually had a valid reason for hiding under blankets! I was just being shy. I fucking love this one. The image in my head has me laughing lol"haha, what a loser, I bet I can get him to do the thing I don't want to do."I would eat in the restroom stall by myself as I read all the things written on the stall walls.  Call this girl for a good time, Jamie Martinez is a loser......I'm actually in highschool and doing the same thing. Most days I just sit in the hall way on Reddit but sometimes (if I'm actually hungry) I'll sit at one of the tables by the corner with some random people.Wow I can't believe how many others did this shit, I thought I was so weird for it.

I would either take a dump in the bathroom the whole time or hide in the library and pretend to do homework.Oh my goodness if you ever get a voicemail from me just delete without listening One time I was leaving a voicemail for someone I was trying to do business with (I'm an artist, she runs a gallery) and I lost my train of thought right in the middle. At first it was just a pause, but then more words refused to come into my brain. Then I started to panic, and I REALLY spaced on what else to say. So I hit 'end.'


So somewhere in the Midwest is a woman with a voicemail on her phone that is totally professional at first, then cuts off mid-sentence, followed by 8 seconds of silence, then ends. I'm really hoping she thinks it was just a phone malfunction, but part of me knows she knows. 


She didn't call me back. is he still your friend?[This method has been proven to work]Same for me. Like I can go shopping provided nobody tries to talk to me. But party or get together I either have to go early and help set up/hang out, or go in with someone else. Even going to the movies (which I used to love) is like a 99% chance of me changing mind about going unless it's a movie I've wanted and waited for years. But those are few and far between. I did this my first day of class this semester, I felt pretty bad about it cause I was in a happy mood and motivated and then had to skip becuase of the anxiety. My first semester, I was so nervous about being late that I'd always get to class early.

One day I was especially early, swung the door open, walked in, and sat down (all eyes on me). Suddenly realized that this wasn't my class, and the class before mine hadn't ended yet. Once I realized, I just got up and walked out. I do something similar. I pull out my phone, pretend I'm reading a text, then throw my head back and let out a frustrated sigh and turn around. And can you believe this is literally their first comment. The only way this happens is if we take it out of this thread, you guyz.

👉😎👉 Zoop!👍😎👍Ayyyyy


👈😬👉ZOOP!Can someone explain this zoop meme? 

Edit: Thanks for the gold on my silly comment. 

When everyone in the thread is using the zoop, and you come across zoop 0, it really isn't any different from the rest. So I thought the story was made up to fill in a zoop, like those undertaker copy pastas. 👉😎👉Please make this a meme.

EDIT: Zoop 👉😎👉 to all you future memelords.👉👉Wow. Tbh this is my first day on reddit. I feel like this is my peak.I don't want to leave the congo
I do this a lot, except I often just won't eat that night because I don't want to be seen.

Or I'll stay up until everyone's in bed, but then sometimes they get up for a smoke or a piss and go, "Oh, when did you get home?"

"...Late!"I don't cook around my older brother. He is a way better cook than me and I just feel the judgment in the air. Can confirm, saw a cucumber and sprung into the air. Will you go to the school dance with me?A similar thing happened to me once.  I was about 13, and at a county fair.  A girl came up to me and randomly asked me for my number.  I gave it to her and felt really good about myself.  A couple hours later, I walked past her and flashed her a smile... she looked away.  Weeks later, I realized she was never going to call, and it was most likely a dare her friends put her up to.  I went about 10 more years before another girl asked me for my number.Better than anything as long as you enjoyed each other's companyThat actually sounds really enjoyable*Sigh* i did this A LOT with the same girl in my bus.

EDIT: actually I also do this thing where I don’t look at people directly in the eyes when I’m talking with them at times. I’ll make eye contact every so often but quickly look at something behind them or just somewhere else in general. why am I like this lol.

EDIT#2: I thank you all for giving me suggestions and justifications on my behavior, saying that it is normal and all, and ways around this issue. There’s comfort in finding out that there are ALOT of people who experience this, so I appreciate all of you for sharing your experiences as well. Hope you guys have a wonderful day/night, wherever you may be. 😁🤗Actually did this once. They were nice shoesOn my last day of work they had a goodbye thing for me and they wanted me to say a speech. You know how people are "speech speech speech".

I was 28 weeks pregnant with 2 days to pack my entire household into 2 move cubes to move to the other side of the world.

I stood in front of everyone and was like "I must start this by saying I hate speeches and presentations. All I can think about are boxes. All of these boxes. Empty boxes which need to be filled before Monday morning and it is midday on Friday. I sleep and dream about these boxes attacking me. Box size 5 mainly."

People just stared. (Edit: I am pretty sure they laughed but my brain has that moment of silence burned into my memory which made me panic xD and I have thus blanked on the rest of the details.)

I quickly ended off with "thank you for the opportunity to work here" and shuffled to the side. Why did you play a harmonica for an interview? 😂😂😂Uh, listen, I went to McDonald's and ordered a big mac and ten chicken nuggets. That's not really a huge meal, right? Even though it's technically two. Whatever, it'll take me a couple hours to get through it anyway. I didn't feel weird about ordering it until the guy handed the bag to me and said "I hope that's not all for you!" 1) I'm not even overweight, but I guess it would be more offensive if you said that then... 2) You don't seem to be very aware of your choice demographic. 3) Don't be rude...WUT?! 

This is a pro tip even if you don't need 2 sandwiches in one sitting!Han Solo'd her gooddang i don't even wanna know what went through her head when she realized i was gone. why are you doing this to me? yeah i'm still recovering I had this guy try to give me a free mixtape for a donation. He started the conversation by hugging me and thanking me for not being afraid of black people. I panicked and said a few random words in Korean (I don't speak Korean) and just kind of walked away.[deleted]Wait, what.. treated for what. Anxiety or Social anxiety? So many questions but I don't want to ask youStranger Things have happened.  
  
Edit: Gold?? Gracias!As somebody who worked at a movie theater for two years, I can say that when people did this, it absolutely made my day. I once was in a situation where saying "you too" was the correct thing to say, I fucked that upIf they only made full length stall walls from floor to ceiling, we probably wouldn't care nearly as much.

I don't want to see their feet or hear them as easily through the large gaps. Just block them off already.  Also, stop manufacturing giant gaps between the locking mechanism to where someone entering the bathroom can see inside the stalls Same thing happened to me when I was in 5th grade. I was in the cafeteria, started choking, totally pretended to be fine because for some reason I couldn't fathom the thought of all those other kids knowing I was choking. The janitor noticed and pretended to come pick up some trash from my table, gave me a hard slap on the back, and I was suddenly fine again. Well, physically I was fine, mentally I was still me though...On the upside, you probably have great investigating skills.It's not creepy, it's called reconnaissance!....lying gives me more anxiety. People with anxiety disorders tend to find telling fibs way more stressful than avoidanceIt was raining harder a second ago I swear!Gets pulled over. Cop" Sir do you know how fast your windshield wipers were going."

 Driver" Officer I swear it was raining harder a minute ago."

Cop" Likely story, you fast wiperers make me sick." Pulls out ticket book. " If I had my way, we would put you in the pokey and throw away the key." That’s super awkward. 
Maybe he was glancing at the only place nobody was to ensure nobody thought he was glancing at them... I do that a lot.Super backwards for me. I stand all day on ladders, on dirt, on concrete. I'll sit down for the rest of the day. Ill walk in the kitchen get something ready and sit on the couch."How's the wife?"

"She left me."

"O-oh, I'm, sorry to hear that--"

"Yeah it fucking sucks. Been getting wasted at Trulluck's every night. The worst part is, she didn't even tell me she was leaving. Just brought her boyfriend and cleared her shit out one day out of the blue. Fucking bitch."

"That's not very appropriate language for the workplace, Jim..."

"Sorry man, I'm just trying to keep it together. My bad."

"All good, bro."I just had this playing out in my head and imagined the person in the stall walking out just as you getting into it and catching you having small talk with yourself. Pizza is an excellent teacher.What am I, made of bus money? As you're walking out say, "oh, excuse me!" and turn around. Make sure you sit in the back so the driver doesn't recognize your shoes.I laughed until I couldn't breathe when he said that. He was mortified and I just laughed in his face."What's your name?"

"Zoop!"Ancient peoples made regular allusions to Aristotle, Homer, and revered holy texts in their written correspondence, and expected that others would understand their references. Before clicking I knew, almost instinctively, that this would be a Spongebob quote.Uuuuuh fork on the left? Do you mean "Weird just yes"?>Howdy

Yeeeeeehaaawww. I don't remember what part of Reddit this came from, but, it was a funny story about some guy that said howdy and the guy he said it to got nervous and said yeehaw.My husband does this. He *still* does this a lot when talking to me and he's already sealed the deal on this lady lol. The reason it never was off-putting or confusing for me was that, even if he was looking all over the damn place when *he* was talking to *me*, when *I* talked to *him* he was very attentive and listened well. So it became obvious that all that was going on was that he was just uncomfortable maintaining eye contact when talking, but that it didn't mean he was uninterested or a douche. So maybe that might help you? If you think of the eye-contact thing as just a thing you'll give yourself a pass on, but then you kind of compensate for it by having your other body language communicate attentiveness and interest in the other person?I feel like this would be my natural response in that situation. They're being morbidly jokey, you can do the same, right? Or like, "Well, if you're only going to buy one more lightbulb for the rest of your life, this should be the one!" I have done that my entire life. 
I thought I was the only one. So much of how I carry myself in daily life is to make sure other people don't feel unsafe around meThey were trying to find the guy that said "You too" when told to enjoy their sandwich.Yeah she laughed and I politely laughed along. I didn't realize what I'd actually said until later. It was so awkward. I didn't even know she was there because it looked like someone just threw a comforter on the floor. Then she emerged and scared the shit out of me, so I couldn't just not acknowledge her. Momentarily forgot the poor woman's name in my awkward haste and called her blanket lady. 

I made my ex drop my kid off today so I wouldn't have to face Blanket Lady again. 😅Saves the student the embarrassment of finding something for them to do though.  Did the bathroom smell?  I can't imagine eating in the bathroom We kinda drifted apart. That comment was inconsequential. Here's a sad thing I've done because of social anxiety though - he's in a band, and I'd wanted to go to a show sometime to support him, but crowded unfamiliar venues with drunk people make me really anxious, so I never did.Disclaimer *may result in pre 10pm blackout*I just loudly exclaim, “Oopsie Daisy!” as I turn around to the right direction. If I’m going to look like an idiot, might as well sound like one, too. Dude i do the exact same thingIt's all downhill from here. She'll forever be chasing the high of the first hit, but never be able to match it.

Poor zooper. 👉😢👉 First comment on reddit gets gilded, 40k upvotes, and starts a meme.

Hot damn.[removed]🖕😐🖕/r/OutOfTheZoop [zoop ](https://imgur.com/gallery/2slVc) We were here. Waive to the meme historians. 👋Zoop! Definitely. Best leave now.If this is your first day congrats. You are going to be seeing zoop and finger guns for forever now. And i love it. Fucking zoop.  

Definitely peaked. [deleted]Does that smell like garlic and disappointment?*runs away*Girls ask for guys' numbers regularly?I'm exactly like this too. I just don't do eye contact so this is the best I can do.My friend was a groomsmen at two weddings i went to and both times during speeches he said "I'm not good at this, love you guys"

Solid speech.It was a 'Talent Show' 😭How could that not be in the forefront of your mind. You first embarrass her by insinuating that she looks like a mall employee and then when she agrees, out of the kindness of her heart, to help you, you bolt. She definitely thought that you were trolling her. She probably thought you were pulling a prank, gave a little shrug then promptly forgot about it. You will never occupy another second of thought from her. She’s even forgotten your face by now so if you ever meet again she won’t even realize it. ...are you okay? Can I get you a shock blanket and some hot chocolate?I was once cold called by someone trying to sell me something, I get really nervous talking on the phone but what if it was important? So I answered and it was some woman trying to sell me crap, so I just said, in perfect English, "I am sorry, I don't speak English". To my horror this didn't work and she transferred me over to this bloke who had a foreign accent who asked me.. something, I don't remember. I literally babbled gibberish at him and he just hung up.I've had such a rough day. This made me laugh inappropriately long. It's evolving at an alarming rate. I wonder what it will be when I wake up tomorrow. 👉😎👉 zoop.General Anxiety which leads to anxiety over anything, including social situations.👉😎👉 Zoop!I started to do that once but realizes and tried to stop myself midway. It ended up being 
"Enjoy your movie"
Me: "You to-NNNHHGHH. Thank you."
Then I grimaced and left I'll start doing this on purpose, just for you“I...I love you” 
“Enjoy your movie”That janitor deserves a medal. You'd be surprised what people put on the internetYeah it's not that hard, just go to the second page of googleI just love how we (humans) are the pinnacle of evolution on earth, and we routinely get taken down by our own brains. i feel*stares outside window to avoid making eye contact*


*realize you're staring directly at someone else in the reflection*And then the other guy finally comes out of the stall and you recognize it is the deaf guy from accounting. Even worse: it's Jim.A warriors greatest weapon..... Is pizza.***WHOOP THERE IT IS***I quit saying, "enjoy your food!" because too many people replied back with, "you too." too often, and I could see the embarrassment in their eyes as they quickly walk away She liked you after happened didn't she? I bet she did. That's awkwardly awesome.still less unappetizing than social interaction.Can confirm. Don't do that unless you are some kind of super heropre 10pm blackout? Oh, I just call those "Saturdays"I pretty much do that. Any time I do something embarrassing I *try* to find someone who saw so I can give a face like "wtf is wrong with me??" Once I just sat down on a bus with my phone in my hand, my hand slammed into the top of the seat and that threw my phone straight up into the air. I caught it, luckily, and turned and saw a girl watching so I just started laughing and gave that look and she gave one back like "dude, I don't know."At least 3 of us in this thread. Now whenever I see this happen I'm not going to believe them.

Not only that, but now we need to think of a new plan!Hello future people trying to figure out why zoop is a thing.

Edit: it's silly this was gilded, but thank you nonetheless.Zoop! *naruto runs awayGenerally once every 12 years or soHave you ever watch 2 people have a conversation where they just maintain eye contact the whole time?! How the fuck do they do that??Can I join your club? I get really creeped out by eyes if I'm looking at them for too long. To the point where my eyes will start streaming.I had one of these before. It was a hiring event, 10 people showed up, and they asked us to do something in the realm of entertaining. Most people sang, told a joke, someone did a handstand. When it got to me, I still hadn't decided what I was going to do, so I burst out of the front door (directly behind me) and sprinted at a trashcan, which I cleanly jumped over (I was dressed in business casual mind you). Apparently after I exited, the manager began to say "some people just can't function under pres-" and then I jumped over the trashcan and ran back. 

Edit: to be clear, the outer wall perpendicular to the entrance was floor to ceiling windows, they didn't see me using xray vision. Can meme'ing be considered as a talent?she was very reluctant and obviously weirded out haha. i think she was trying to get it over with, based only on her facial expressions. i just finished a hot chocolate but i would love a blanket. thank you. And did you see a counselor? My son is 10 and so hard on himself, hates leaving the house, is always getting good grades but thinks he's not smart, etc... If this doesn't become a thing I will be very upsetI've definitely done that before.  
  
"Enjoy your meal!"  
"You tooooookay I will thanks!"ALL janitors deserve medals.The dark web?Google has multiple pages?I swear to god I will think myself to death before any of my organs fail. Oh my god you brought up something in me.  
I was biking home through absolutely horrendous rain once and decided to stop under an overhang and wait it out for a bit. This was a shop of sorts and I just kind of stared at my drenched reflection in the window, completely zoning out and enjoying not being pelted with buckets of water. Then a few minutes later I suddenly snapped out of it because somebody was closing the blinds, and only then I noticed the 5 old ladies sitting inside. I had been staring at them with a wet, soulless stare for an uncomfortable amount of time and they were looking at me with judging faces, as if I was about to murder them or something. It was so damn cringy at the time.  Life is more than a series of doughs and toppings.In order to avoid that, my default response is an overly enthusiastic "OK!", which is weird in itself. What really bothers me, though, is when I automatically use it to respond to compliments. That's **really** awkward, and I do it every time.She loved me, I think she was more upset when we split up than her son was. 👉😎👉 𝕫𝕠𝕠𝕡!Casuals.Hi! 👋It responds to the finger emojis not the zoop.

👉😎👉😎👉👉*jumps from tree to tree, but somehow it’s the same tree over and over*Fucking. Sorcery.I'm fucking dying lol. Also that is a retarded way to host a job interviewThis happened to me too, at a friends birthday party when we were about 7 or 8. We were playing musical chairs and shit, and at some point it was time for a "talent show". Anyone who could do something got to pick a prize. I didn't know what to do, but one of the prizes was a packet of [plasticine](https://i.imgur.com/S7K02xG.jpg) which I *really* wanted, so I thought fuck it I'll think of something by the time it's my turn and volunteered. 

Birthday guy goes first and does "jingle bells batman smells", and of course I'm called up next, with no time to think of anything, so I stand up and just start fucking freestyling a poem which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, and I still remember the last line, apparently I was trying to end on a deep note: "life is... not like.. a..... mop". The face on one of the parents as she clapped will be burned into my mind forever, she did a good job forcing a smile through the cringe. I knew at the time it was bad, but at least I got some plasticine.you seem like you would be familiar with that expression so i'll take your word for it. lol

Could be depression too if it's been going on a while. I think depression/anxiety are often co-morbid anyway, it might be something to think about. 

I was in pretty rough shape at that age and even though I knew *something* was wrong with me I could never articulate it, my parents never took me to get help. I wish they had.👉😎👉 [zoop](https://imgur.com/gallery/2slVc) Hugs to everyone.  It is really helpful to hear other people admit they go through the same shit, thank you.  Zoop.Shit. This one time I was waiting for my mom to get back to the car from fetching groceries. Bored, I saw a speck on the window and started to scratch it off, focused on it for a bit. Suddenly I realize there's a guy sitting in a car parked next to mine looking at this dumb fuckin kid staring cross-eyed at him, dragging his finger on the window like he's about to [start licking it](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=window%20licker). It was my source of late night trying-to-fall-asleep cringe for several months.You can always rekindle the flame Everyone here now is from the future 😂👉😎👉

A few years back my fiance and I read a reddit comment about zooping, which is sticking your finger in your significant other's butt and saying "ZOOP" while in the shower.

---Norway. Endless nature, giant pretty mountains, drinkable see-through water, so many rocks to jump on, very few people in sight, 9/10. I would go in the summer though.Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada.

The most beautiful place I’ve ever visited.The view from the top of Table Mountain in Cape Town. It was like a vision of eternity. No photograph could possibly show how how beautiful that view is. Arthur's seat in Edinburgh Scotland. Incredible climb for an incredible view of the country.

Edit: We accidentally took the radical road instead of the actual trail up to the top. There's like this mostly flat tourist trail on the left,  and the radical road to the right. Rad road goes straight up, just below the summit, then straight down back to the road. It took about an hour and a half altogether. We were insanely lucky to get up there on a clear, sunny day. So we got a great view!The $4.00 go-carts on the main drag at the Wisconsin Dells.  Super cheap and you get to go for like 10 minutes.   The Cliffs of Moher

https://imgur.com/JJJu9qmFor me - Iceland. I went at the very start of the 'season', so got the benefit of being able to do all the things without insane crowds.

this is the coolest thing I've ever done on any trip:

Also, Norway and Ireland are fucking gorgeous.

And Italy is an art lover's paradise.The Pacific Rim National Park,Canada. It's a temperate rainforest with huge trees that are hundreds of years old.Austria. I felt like no matter which direction I looked it was like a picture from a postcard. I expected the people to be somewhat cold but they were very friendly and welcoming, I'd love to go back.New Zealand, I went there this July so in the middle of their winter and my Kiwi mate was telling me how cold it would be (I'm English btw) and it was autumnal. The landscapes are just amazing, I walked up to Roy's Peak and the views were amazing. I went hiking on a glacier and if it was summer I could have gone surfing in the same day. Also the roads are great, most of the highways are 1 lane but the roads are so empty that it doesn't make a difference. Yosemite National Park in California.

Everything was super sized and beautiful. Hiking in a normal local park, even if it has mountains and waterfalls, just feels small now.Did: The Greek islands.

Did not: Athens.The Cabot Trail, ~~Halifax~~ Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, Canada  

Gros Morne National Park, Newfoundland, Canada

Edit: Fixed the place, sorry guys.
Ireland. People were beyond friendly and it was like a jolly pub celebration complete with trad every night. The bar atmosphere is so different-- less sleazy dudes trying to get it and people being friendly to actually be friendly. It was wonderful. Went to Walmart as a European guy. Leading up to going there I've been told it's nothing special and it will be an anticlimax. After we arrived I saw there was a McDonalds IN the Walmart. Easily the best experience of muricaness my life. 

Best part of everything, there were TWO scootmobiles of fat people inside. Edinburgh in the Christmas season. It was magical. The only downside to Edinburgh was a problem that sadly all cities have: lots of homeless people. (To be clear: they themselves aren't the problem, the homelessness epidemic is.)I don't see much Asia on here so lemme just:

-The Inari Gates (Kyoto, Japan) 

-The arcade district in Tokyo (I forget the name but just skyscrapers full of arcade games) 

-Lotte World (Seoul, SK) the largest indoor amusement park, not intended for adults but we didn't care

-Honestly, Seoul has zero hype and is super underrated, Korea isn't very touristy so everything is authentic and a blast. The DMZ did *not* live up to the hype and was the only touristy part of the whole country as far as I saw. Kauai  :-)Prague. It was like a metropolitan medieval town. Budapest is simply magnificent!Prague and Santorini did. Especially if you go close to the off-season.

And the general atmosphere of Barcelona and Amsterdam makes your soul feel refreshed.Seeing red wood trees in Northern California. Being at the base of a red wood for the first time is something I'll never forget. Yellowstone, we JUCY RV'd around the west coast for 4 weeks. Yellowstone blew my mind; beautiful place, fantastic tours with park rangers, incredible wildlife, and a massive range of scenery. From the colours of grand prism, the power of old faithful, the grassy buffalo habitats, to the rocks and mountain goats. Breathtaking. Macchu Picchu.  

Even if you aren't into the whole ancient city (which I kind of get it...it's crowded as hell and you're essentially just walking through), the view is fucking incredible with the mountains all around.  

There's a pathway that leads off the city and gives you a wild panorama of the ruins and all the surrounding mountains.  There's very few people up there (because it's a hell of a walk) so it's quiet and you just get to take it all in.  The town underneath Macchu Picchu is also really cool because it's essentially just built up the side of a mountain

[Album if you're interested](https://imgur.com/a/Kry5N)...The second picture is the one from the top of the pathway.  The city looks empty because I definitely photoshopped every tourist out of those.The Oregon Coast.  To be fair, I'd never heard any hype about it, but if there is hype, it's totally accurate.  Sitting on a patio overlooking a beach with steel grey waves crashing in, eating a bowl of slumgullion while drinking a rogue ale.  The air is chilly and foggy, but under the tent roof of the fish and chip shop you're totally comfortable.  Then the sun comes out and you comb the beach for agates while keeping an eye for those sneaker waves.Wadi Rum, a desert preserve in the South of Jordan.  It's beautiful.  My wife and I visited Jordan this summer and spent the night in Wadi Rum with a Bedouin guide and his son.  It was a fantastic experience and I highly recommend it.  Never in my life have I seen so many stars or such a beautiful sunset.For me; Japan. GUYS! SWITZERLAND. beyond majestic. a bit pricey, but fuck I've never been to a more beautiful place

edit: geez :,) thank you for the gold and for all the great tips for the next time i make a trip over thereScotland.  It really is like a real life version of the first Highlander movie.the Grand Canyon.. it is beyond amazing. it truly makes you feel tiny. I hiked down one of the trails (not all the way down) and it was an amazing experience. 10/10 would most definitely go again.

Edit: here is a photo of me feeling small 

https://i.imgur.com/a4BgamZ.jpg
Mount Everest Base Camp! (Tibet side)

It may sound silly but I was kinda nervous Everest wouldn’t actually look like the tallest mountain in the world or something, or even worse too cloudy to see. In actuality she was majestic and I had great weather, and seeing all the expeditions preparing was a life highlight for me. Got tears in my eyes because Everest seemed like the moon- a place I dreamed about in my childhood but you don’t *really* go to. I couldn’t believe I was there!

Wow was the elevation tough though. Khao Sok, Thailand.

Don't search it in Google images if you don't want to get depressed with your current location.[deleted]Honestly I was around Southern Alaska and it was the most beautiful place I’ve been to, being from Missouri. It looked a lot like I saw on tv shows and the scenery was breathtaking. Plus I got some nice pictures to take home as a bonus.Lake Tahoe. It's absolutely beautiful there. The highlands of Scotland and city of Edinburgh were amazing, 10/10. The people were incredibly friendly, talkative, and helpful, the pubs were lively and fun. Can't wait to go back again.  
Also Zion nation park in Utah was amazing, it's like a little paradise in the middle of the desert. Quebec City!

Just got back two weeks ago. Food was great, service was great, people were all nice. Everybody. Feels like you're in Europe.

10 out of 10.Copenhagen, Denmark. 

Fabulous.Hawaii. It's a beautiful place and we go back as often as we can.Croatia. Absolutely beautiful country. Costa Rica. I had only heard great things about it. The people, the weather, etc. The resort I was at was amazing and we got to get out into the town's and see the real Costa Rica. Going back there next year!Salem during Halloween. Everyone should do this once in their lives. New Orleans over Halloween was also amazing but we expected it to be. 

Mine and my girlfriends anniversary is Halloween so we go to different places on that day to celebrate. Some places i have seen mentioned, so I will say Porto. It's still relatively cheap (50 cents for a very nice coffee), and it's regional dish is a francesinha, a meal of bread, cheese, 2 types of ham, 2 types of sausage, more cheese, bread an egg, and extra cheese sauce. And chips, if you want additional carbs. I could spend all day looking at the bridge that spanned the Douro and walking round the old town admiring the azulejos. And there's lots of easy day trips you can make to Braga, Guimares (sp?), Coimbra, etc. And the locals are very friendly, even if Portugese sounds like a Dutch person trying to speak Spanish.Tasmania!  Australia in general was awesome, but Tasmania far exceeded expectations.  Great food, art, wildlife and wilderness, friendly people, clean and unpolluted.  

Heron Island also really lived up to the hype, crazy expensive but worth every penny.Moab utah! Especially if you're into anything from mountain biking to full on 4 wheeling. If there is annother thing close to moab in beauty and off road terrain i would love to hear about itRome. Hands down. I still can't get over the awe I felt seeing the Collosseum for the first time. And the food is incredible. Everywhere you turn, there's an incredible piece of history.

That being said, do watch your pockets... Torres del Paine National Park in Chile. The formations, glaciers, meadows, lakes- all phenomenal.Belize is a fucking amazing country.Munich. I've been twice, both times in early summer. The old city is beautiful and is an awesome place to just grab a beer and wander around.I found London to be amazing. The museums in particular were incredible. Did a semester abroad there and it was the best semester of school for me.

I've also never been to somewhere quite like Newfoundland, Canada. Gros Morne National Park was absolutely unique, and hauntingly beautifulI went to San Francisco with absolutely no expectations. It was just a quick weekend before a wedding in LA. Was completely surprised by how much I loved it. Wandered around the city on a beautiful November afternoon. 

Go figure that the one US city I'd love more than my hometown of NYC would be the one city here that's more expensive.Yosemite National ParkAmsterdam:  Beautiful, historic, friendly people, easy to explore.  I was heading to Singapore next so didn't risk trying any of the local herbs, but I did walk through the red-light district for some eye-candy.  

Paris:  While the people are only friendly if you speak French like a native, I enjoyed myself anyway.  Great food around almost any corner, beautiful architecture, easy to get around, lots to do and see.Norway.

I remember the train ride from Bergen to Oslo... 8 hours, listening to Sigur Ros, I shed tears looking out the window. 

Jackson Hole, Wyoming.Mexico City for sure. Super cheap to fly there from the U.S. The food is absolutely amazing and the people are extraordinarily friendly not to mention everything is super cheap. Tons of cool museums and neighborhoods to walk around in and Teotihuacan is a must-see. I'd go back every year if I had more vacation time.ISTANBUL.
It’s amazing. 
As an American Jew my family was like “SAY YOURE CANADIAN AND ATHEIST”
It was So normal. A wonderful mix of modern and old. Amazing people and museums, and just generally fucking amazing.Malaga, Spain - I read a lot of opinions saying either it was great or boring.  We loved it!

Namibia - People are awesome, food and animals are a bonus.As a car nut, the Nurburgring, Germany. The entire province of British Columbia.  Ive been quite a few times as i have family there.  But this year my cousin was getting married in the summer so my gf and i decided to fly to Calgary, rent a car and drive to Vancouver.   I can not describe the beauty of the mountainscapes and the scenery, and im not a nature person in the least.  We went to lake louise and moraine lake as out first stop...absolutely breathtaking.  Crystal clear glacier water, mountains on either side and miles and miles of hiking trails. 

Overnighted in revelstoke and visited with friends in vernon who gave us a tour of the okanagan region.  The people are super friendly and welcoming.  The fact that the sky was almost perpetually grey because of all the forest fires this year didnt even take away from the sights.

I would definitely reccommend doing the drive from cal to bc.  Once in a lifetime experience and there's no shortage of attractions along the way.  Theres a reason we saw plates from texas, florida, nova scotia, new york etc etc.  People know how awesome it is there.Germany. In my experience, no one really talks about Germany as a place to visit - it’s often overshadowed by France, Spain, Italy... but during my 6 months in Europe, I fell in love with Germany out of any of the countries I saw. The culture is great, the people were some of the most welcoming and generous I met, the food exceeded my expectations, and I loved the area and the sights. I spent most of my time in very southern Germany (Konstanz/Constance), but saw Munich, Berlin, Freiburg, Straßbourg, and Salzburg (which is technically Austria, but is very very north so shares a lot with Germany). 

Germany was beautiful, cheap, accepting, kind, and overall my favorite place in Europe, closely followed by Bellagio, a tiny town in Northern Italy on Lake Como, and Alicante, a city in southeastern Spain. I largely found that my favorite spots were the smaller cities and towns rather than the sprawling metropolises - Paris and Rome were very underwhelming, but Germany exceeded my wildest expectations. Budapest is my favorite city on Earth. It's actually divided in two, so the Buda and the Pest sides are divided by the Danube River. Both sides have a unique but awesome vibe, and the prices in Budapest are sooo inexpensive compared to western Europe. 

Pest has an amazing night life and I've had one of the best nights of my life there. Very New York City vibe, but without the skyscrapers. Ruin pubs are definitely the thing to check out. They're bars that were once residential buildings but they make for a very cool atmosphere. 

The Buda side is absolutely beautiful, full of incredible buildings and sculptures everywhere you go. I loved walking around the Buda Castle, and Fisherman's Bastion was stunning as well. The bathhouses are also a must visit since Budapest is famous for its thermal waters. I went to Gellert Bathhouse and it was like swimming around in a museum. 

All in all, I can't wait to go back. Newfoundland, so many things to do and the people are all very nice and welcoming.
 New Zealand, mostly all of it!

New York because it's New York, it's a place you really have to experience.

Vegas, because I have never been anywhere else like it and it's too much fun! Though the beer is pretty fucking expensive. As an add-on the 9 hour drive and back to the Grand Canyon south rim was worth it, even if I was only there for 90 minutes, really fucking worth it! That place really is deserving of the word "indescribable".

Northern Highlands in Scotland because they are stunning.Definitely Italy, also Jamaica is pretty nice The Biggest Ball of Twine in Minnesota.

When I saw it I was just so overwhelmed by its sheer imensity, I had to pop myself a beer.

The North Shore of Minnesota. Though not often mentioned, It is amazing to visit during the summer and winter. Even though I live in Duluth, its still amazing. New York is pretty rad as long as you stay away from the Times Square area.Rockingham North Carolina. No hype to live up to so it works

Edit: thanks for the goldColorado was pretty nice. 3 mile trails you can take around 20 or more minutes to ski down was super relaxing, and the views were breathtaking. But it was pretty expensive.Key West, Florida.  Just so beautiful, serene, and out in the middle of basically nowhere.  The trip there is pretty neat as well, once you get past the mess of Ft. Lauderdale/Miami, you get to the Overseas highway, over 100 miles long to Key West, island after island.

The Seven mile bridge is also pretty neat, that's between Marathon and Little Duck Key, the demarcation between the middle keys and the lower keys.

Once you get to Key West, the main happenings are on Duval street.  On the southern end of that is that buoy that's the Southermost place in the US.  It is a little ugly looking, but it's neat to stand at the point and know that you at this point in time are standing as far south in the continental US than anyone else.Chicago is pretty damn awesome. I loved that city and want to go back!I've been lucky to travel around a fair bit and the fjords of Norway are the most incredible thing I've ever seen full stop. Not to mention the fact that the people are absolutely gorgeous.  You will consistently see drop dead beautiful women (and men honestly) everywhere.And Bergen specifically, for me. What a place.Yes! I spent 6 days in Norway back in April 2011. When my great-great-grandparents came to America, they stayed in touch with their family in Norway, meaning we're still all in touch. I had met some of my Norwegian cousins when they visited America, but this trip allowed me to meet pretty much all of them. Oslo, Bergen, and the family farm were all just beautiful. I really hope to return one day. I studied abroad there for six months three years ago and am constantly finding myself just lost in thought, wishing I was back there. God I love that country and as an environmentalist and biologist, the view that most people have towards nature and getting outside (friluftsliv!). I swear the little five year old Norwegian children I was working with at a nature school could build a fire in the pouring rain with one match. I love that country.. just went back in February and still feel I have barely scraped the surface of seeing all I want to see. The most beautiful site known to ManffTotally agree. Lake Louise was just stunning.I'm headed to cape town in January! Table mountain is on the list, any other must see spots?

Edit: thanks for all the suggestions!

Edit 2: wow I'm overwhelmed reading all theses options, and even more excited for my trip now! Thanks redditors!Just went there last week. It was cool (took the gondola), but hiking up Lion's Head and getting a 360 degree view was better IMO.

Edit: pics from both.  
https://imgur.com/a/7flrT
I learned just how out of shape I was climbing up there, but I made it just as the sun was setting. It was so windy that it blew my bus ticket out of my pocket and I had to walk back to my hotel. Totally worth it!Yeah so I have a story about Arthur’s Seat. I decided to hike up there when I was in Edinburgh one morning. It was pouring rain. I went down the wrong trail several times, fell on the mud and slipped on wet grass repeatedly (at one point I just lay on the ground staring at the sky, rain pelting me in the face, wondering how I'd gotten here). Finally I find the right path, make my way up and am greeted with this view.

https://imgur.com/a/yzTko

I climb back down, falling a whole bunch more. Have to wind my way back around the hill and walk towards town (accidentally found the Rockstar building) climbed up the steep ass hill in town to get back to the hotel. Later that day we go to the castle and I turn to look at where Arthur’s Seat is and it now looks like this.

https://imgur.com/a/bdS8Q

Scotland was awesome though. Took a vacation to Europe a year ago, can confirm. Scotland as a whole definitely exceeded my expectations. Beautiful landscape and cities.Can confirm, but I'd say Edinburgh in general. I could live there! It has the feel of a big city, but spaced it so it feels like as suburb and more chill. Not to mention the great architecture. God I miss it there.As somebody who grew up in Superior, and Wisconsin Dells was the "every other summer if we could afford it family vacation," let me tell you, there are no better go-carts in the world than at Wisconsin Dells. I went to school at UW-Madison and my friends and I would go more often just for fun in the summer and when you get those wooden tracks with just the slightest bit of rain before they shut down due to weather... 

It's basically Mario Kart, equipped with full-on banana peel spins. Complete power sliding through the Trojan Horse spirals.  I love your reply so so so so much. Thanks for the nostalgia.Rome this, New Zealand that, blah blah... this is what I'm talkin aboutI just spent some time in Wisconsin for a work trip. Such a beautiful state!

Also, cheese curds. As a Wisconsinite can confirm. Go early in the season to beat the damn FIBsI grew up 10 minutes from the dells and would spend a ton of time there in my youth. It's an interesting place. It's actually some what of a cultural melting pot during the summer months. Beautiful lakes, cheap and fun attractions, tons of people to meet. My man.You saw the Cliffs of Moher? I was 5 feet away from them and I didnt even see them. That was the windiest and foggiest weather I've ever experienced.InconceivableWe were so excited and found out that we much preferred the Cliffs of Kerry. Both were beautiful but Moher was overcrowded and tourist nightmare, where we had almost the entire countryside to ourselves at the Cliffs of Kerry. 

Glad we did both, though. I was there this past February- highly recommend! Didn't do the volcano, but we did the Northern Lights tour.This so much, I've been in several countries in Europe and in south America, but Iceland is different, there are lots of different landscapes really close to others.
If you think in a country you surely will think "yeah, this place with X thing that makes it special", but Iceland is the places with all those things.
Volcanos, glaciers, waterfalls, caves, mountains, rivers, pools and the best, aurora borealis. I've seen the others wonders and there are better ones than in Iceland (if you want to see glaciers and waterfalls go to Argentina, if you like beer, greengrass and castles go to Ireland, mountains? go to switzerland, etc), but in the only place I could see auroras was there and it was breathtaking.
So if you want to see as much as you can, go to Iceland, within a week and not much kilometres you will feel like that you have been in 3 different countries.

So far, my favorite country.

PD: I went in October, the weather was fine and there weren't as many tourists as it could be in June.scrolled the whole thread hoping id see Iceland! I leave for there on friday. I am so damn excited. Really hoping i see some northern lights.I'm from the West Coast of Canada and grew up visiting these parks regularly. When I lived and traveled overseas, I was surprised by how many people told me that their holiday to BC was one of the most amazing things they'd ever done.

When I returned home after a few years abroad, I was floored with how beautiful BC is. Growing up here, you can start to take it for granted. I now know how lucky I am to have been born here into a position in life that afforded me the opportunity to experience as normal what some people remember as their most favourite holiday. Also, Kaiju in their natural habitat.Ayyy I live on Vancouver Island. This whole island is magical. Tofino is a land of dreams.Haida Gwaii (the former Queen Charlottes) are stunning As islanders, can we all just come to a mutual agreement to stop talking about it?Once I was in Salzburg, and after getting lost on the big hill south of downtown, I ended up at the Augustinerbräu, where a random assortment of locals at my table and I played a game with dyed boiled eggs and bought each other elderflower liquor for hours. Super friendly people in Austria. As an austrian i just have to ask, where have you been to?

Edit: Holy shit i somehow didn't expect to get so many answers. I'm glad most of you enjoyed you'r stay in Austria PRO TIP: Go in November. It's the "off season" for tourism so it's super cheap. We stayed in [Schloß Grubhof](http://hmigroup.com.au/~hmigroup//cmsb/uploads/schloss.jpg), a literal 14th century palace-turned-hotel, for $50 a night for the four of us. It was absurd because in order to leave the town you basically went along a road along the base of some of the most gorgeous mountains in the Alps. It was absolutely stunning and so cheap, I loved it. Plus it's near Salzburg, which is a great city.Vienna is what people think Paris is like. Incredible, architecture, art, food, and history. To have just one of their art galleries would be incredible to have as many as they do (Belvedere, Secession, Albertina, Schönbrunn, kunsthistorisches, academy of fine arts) is just cheating (I could spend all day looking at the Belgian/Dutch Old Masters in the Culture Museum). The city is unbelievably clean, the public transport is great, and I could eat schnitzel every day. I went in March when there were barely any tourists which also helped (also the £ was 1.40 to the Euro which I will probably never see again). It got to the stage where i'd round the corner and go 'oh *another*  beautiful 18th century sculpture. Meh'Vienna is one of my all-time favourite cities. So much history and culture. Innsbruck is probably the most beautiful place I have ever seen in my life. We stayed in a hotel up in one of the mountain sides that overlooked the valley/city and I swear I entered some sort of trance state when the sun started setting over the mountains. Gorgeous. Dude, Im going to Austria next week! Vienna specifically. This makes me happy to hearSecond this, I went to New Zealand for a little over a week last July! The whole landscape is just so scenic and tranquil, sometimes I would just stop somewhere off the side of the endless quiet roads just to breathe in the air and look at the horizon and mountains. I traveled from Christchurch to Queenstown, making stops in Wanaka and a town close to Pukaki Lake (forgot the town's name), but my god was it stunning. Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park was absolutely one of the best places I've been to - I've never seen mountains so *powerful*. 

Queenstown was typical tourist place, but pretty cool in of itself. I made the hike up to Milford Sound, which was pretty great. Almost like taking a scene out of Jurassic Park.

Gotta say, New Zealand (at least the South Island, didn't travel to the North Island) lived up to its hype.

Edit: The town(s) that were close to Lake Pukaki were Twizel and Tekapo. Also made a stop at Lake Tekapo!

Edit2: I rented a car for about 7-8 days to cross-country drive from Christchurch down to Queenstown.Agreed. I grew up near the Grand Canyon and Sedona, AZ (both of which were probably mentioned in this thread), and have been all kinds of places all over the world, and New Zealand's Milford Sound remains my #1 most beautiful place I've ever been. Like the Grand Canyon, pictures don't really do it justice. 

 The scenery in NZ is just unbelievable, and is so varied for a such a small country - from classic South Pacific tropical island beaches in the north, to the geological wonders of Rotorua, to Lord of the Rings-style mountain ranges, Norwegian-style fjords, and Antarctic rain forests (complete with cold-weather parrots) in the south. It is truly God's country.I have a trip planned to New Zealand in a couple months and am outrageously excited. Very much looking forward to hiking and checking out the landscapes. What would you say was your favorite thing to see? I'm going with a tour group but have a little bit of free time, so always looking for recommendations!I'm literally at the gate for a flight to NZ right now! What are some other things I should check out while I'm there?New Zealand is amazing! After having been in both winter and summer, the experiences are completely different, yet still amazing. The north island has so many things to do that I still haven't been able to make it to the south island - but Milford Sound is a bucket list item, so I'll get there eventually.

My heart sinks when I think about not being able to make it back there for a few years.Trust me, a lot of the roads are shite. Yes, New Zealand is incredible. For our honeymoon we spent two weeks in Australia and one week in New Zealand, and I wish we had swapped it and spent most of the time in NZ. Australia was great and we had fun there, but NZ was super amazing. 

They have like no animals that will kill you. That's what I look for in a vacation.True, best 2 years of my life so far. I loved every bit of NZ. I have been everywhere, we spent sooo much time on the way, like 8 months straight. Northland and Molesworth Station are my personal favourites, I don't know why, the atmosphere up there was surreal.Man, I love this. I'm a kiwi and it's cool to hear all the great things about my country.Also awed by some Californians who live in the area. There was one lady who looked like she was in her 20s when looking from behind while hiking, but turns out she is in her 60s and hikes everyday.Visited the valley this July. Am from Indiana. Can definitely confirm this feeling.How is this so low, Yosemite is one of the most beautiful places you will ever see. I prefer Sequoia National Forest, same incredible trees (not as amazing waterfalls but still beautiful) with a lot less people. They also have the largest creature to have ever lived on earth there, and it's mind blowing.  Was there about a month ago. The valley (especially El Capitan up close) was mind-blowing. As a Greek living in Athens, I don't get why people come here. Everyone should honestly visit the Acropolis and some other monuments and hop on a ship to some island. Two days was sufficient for Athens when I went.  One day to sight-see all the historical markers, one day to explore, shop, and eat.  I really liked the vibe in Athens. And Greek islands are awesome. Been to about 10 of them now!Which islands did you go to?

Also Athens is nice for a day or two (I say this having lived there for three years), but other than the Acropolis and Acropolis and Benaki Museums, don't ever stay in Athens unless it's to see stuff that's close-ish to Athens (Cape Sounio, Marathon, Nafplion, Corinth etc, all of those are under 90 minutes driving from Athens).

For islands, the best ones IMO are Paros, Crete (Chania especially), and Santorini.Santorini is seriously the most beautiful place I've ever seen.Honestly Newfoundland in general is pretty amazing, I was not prepared for how beautiful it was there and the people are just great.Yes! But the Cabot trail is not in Halifax, which is the capital of Nova Scotia. It is on Cape Breton IslandI'll second both of these!  Gros Morne (the park) also has the Tablelands, just across Bonne Bay from Gros Morne (the mountain), and Western Brook Pond, an inland fjord. They are all among the most spectacular landscapes I've seen--and the park was virtually empty in June.Wow, I really need to visit that side of Canada. Just for clarification's sake, the Cabot Trail isn't really in Halifax. Or that close to it really. It's on Cape Breton island which forms the northern chunk of the province. It's comparable to saying you visited Stonehenge, London, UK. Yeah you could fly to London then drive but it's not exactly close.Ireland is one of the two places I would visit again (Australia being the second, so far). Some trips end with, "that was fun. where do we go next?" but Ireland ended with, "when can we come back?"

The people were great. The scenery is spectacular. There's so much history there that I could spend a week visiting historic sites alone. The Burren, in my opinion, is a very underrated attraction. It has a beauty to it that I really enjoyed. I would definitely want to re-visit the Ring of Kerry, though, and spend a few days hiking and camping there.Been to Ireland twice. Love it there. First time stayed in Dublin. Second time got to Glendalough and out to Dingle on the west coast. Gorgeous country and the friendliest people.

edit: speelingFrom Ireland myself and that was the big difference I noticed when in the States. All of the guys there are posturing in bars and such.

Just get a pint and shut up, lad!

Edit: posturing is puffing out your chest and trying to look tough while simultaneously being loud to scare off other male competitors and draw attention to yourself from females. Similar to peacocking.Well you hit the nail on the head there. Life feels like a celebration over there, as it should. Great craic. I'm glad someone said it. I've never felt more at home in a place than Ireland. The place I stayed had a job board in the lobby, I'd look at it every time I walked through because I was thinking I might not leave.this is too true! I love the whole Island. Everyone was so friendly.

Edit: When I was in Belfast(I know it's northern Ireland, let me liiiive), me and my partner went a separate place and didn't know how to get to the rest our party, so we called an uber. the driver was alive during the troubles and told about his experiences as a kid and pointed out places that got bombed and stuff on the way there

In Dublin we were looking for places that had vegetarian stuff and my dad stopped at a bar and the guy pointed out like 3 places. He also remarked on the restaurant next door, "The guy who owns that place is a butcher, I don't think he even knows what a vegetable is"

Edit 2: Guys, I get it. The Good Friday agreement was signed in the 90s, I misspoke. I meant to say he was a kid during the The Troubles. Just got back from there. I'd advise anyone to go. The whole country is awesome but Galway and west coast as whole really got me. My favourite part about ireland is everyones sense of humour. I was actually surprised when i realised other countries use swear words to insult each other.Also, the bars play music at a reasonable volume that allows people to actually have conversations! (I'm thinking of regular bars with recorded music, not live music spots.) Coming back to American bars after that was so depressing.As an Irish person. It's nice to know people enjoy themselves whilst they are here, I personally do my best to have a chat with every tourist I come across whilst at work ( work at the seaside every summer and as medical personal at events ). While the craic in the pubs is mighty is not all that's to be enjoyed in our little green Island in the AtlanticSláinteCame here to post this as well. 

From Massachusetts. Drove Ireland from Dublin to cork to Galway this summer visiting colleges. My daughter wants to go to college there. I approve. 

Galway was perfect. Mohir was amazing. 

Damn that country knows how to make butter. I couldn't agree more. I went to Dublin a few years ago on vacation. Since it was my first trip overseas, I was kinda nervous and even more socially awkward than ever and resorted to sitting at the bar, humming along to the DJ's music. A short while later a bunch of guys came up to me and started making conversation and bought me a beer and encouraged me to dance ( am a guy and this has never happened before). I felt so touched and happy to be there - they made me feel so comfortable even though I was among a bunch of strangers. I started relaxing a bit thereafter and ended up having a great night ( even picked up an Irish lass ;) )In Cork one night, my wife told a pair of old guys the old "liquor? I hardly know her!" line and got a shocked silence followed by explosive laughter. One of my favorite Irish memories. I'm in Ireland right now and it's been fantastic. After a tour I went bar hopping with two of the tour guides. Despite being a young girl alone, and the tour guides being male, and going to a bunch of pubs I didn't recognize, I never once felt unsafe or uncomfortable. They were super friendly, understanding when I said I wanted to take it easy on my drinks (because despite feeling safe I'm not totally naive), and made sure I was okay and knew the way back to my hostel. 

Sitting outside a pub with a pint watching the two guys sing loudly like there's no tomorrow will definitely go down as one of the most fun nights of my life. So many more things I wanted to see and do in Ireland! We rented a car and almost circumnavigated the whole island. Big portion of the west coast we missed, and I’m a sucker for the ocean. We had planned to go surfing(by Bundoran, I think) as well but I was pregnant so we decided to cancel.  
  
Everything was beautiful, everyone was friendly, the B&Bs were wonderful. Trip was 10/10!Seriously, the nicest people ever. I'd go back just for the Irish.I went to Ireland this summer before my 18th birthday. The airport security guard seemed so sad that I wasn't of drinking age. It was such an Irish welcome to the country. I definitely want to go back now that I'll have that freedom to enjoy the atmosphere. Sure we're a fecking great bunch of ladsWow I’m putting that place on my bucket list nowI've been to Ireland twice and I'm planning a trip for next summer with my boyfriend. I cannot wait, I absolutely love that country and the people. Even compared to places nearby like Scotland and England the atmosphere is just so much better. In a Scots pub you feel like a fight could break out at any time. Only 2? Damn, we'll do better next time.Lmfao I definitely think everyone who isn't American should visit a small town Wal-Mart when they get the chance. You'll come away understanding so much about this country. I was in Edinburgh for Christmas a few years ago and every Christmas since I've wished I was in Edinburgh.Not even just Christmas time, but always.  I have been to several countries in Europe and the Americas, and Edinburgh is still by far one of my favorite cities.  Want to get back there so bad.Edinburger here: Edinburgh is nice around Christmas-Hogmanay to visit, but oh God, the Crowds. 

Same with the Festival: Great, the world's best comedians are coming to Edinburgh but ***OH GOD I CAN'T GET DOWN PRINCES STREET OR THROUGH THE MILE WITHOUT A CATTLE PROD OH GOD!***I love love love the Christmas festival in downtown - honestly Edinburgh is one of my top five cities in the world I love at all times of year. The Scottish in me is thrilled to see Scotland so close to the top...the Glaswegian in me is gutted it’s Edinburgh. ;) "I hate the homless...
...ness problem in our city"Oh man, I *loved* Scotland. Me and my buddy went there last May, rented a car, and [went in a big loop](https://www.reddit.com/r/vargas/comments/6b4csr/vargas_big_scottish_road_trip_part_one_jet_lag/) around the country. Truly spectacular, especially Glencoe and Skye. Fun fact: not only are you allowed to drive on the left side of the road in Scotland, it is actually encouraged. Currently here on my honeymoon. I am gonna eat my way around that Christmas market in Princes Street Gardens, it smells amazing.I lived abroad for a while, based in London, and traveled around Western Europe quite often. 

Edinburgh blew everything else out of the water. I grew up in Edinburgh. It's a lovely city but the amount of tourists is pushing it to saturation point now. I went back to see my parents in September and the number of tourists in Grassmarket was comparable to the numbers in July 10 years ago. The city centre is quickly becoming Disneyland. 

However, you can't beat the Water of Leith under the Dean Bridge on a good day> The arcade district in Tokyo (I forget the name but just skyscrapers full of arcade games)

Akihabara. I made a point of checking it out when I was in Tokyo and it really is crazy. There's nothing quite like it anywhere else I've been, an entire city district dedicated to gaming and nerd culture. There are other similar areas such as streets in Ikebukuro where my friend and I were wandering and found a giant Pokemon store on accident (and also saw an idol girl group performing live which was far creepier than I would have thought).

Japan is weird and wonderful.Some hidden gems in Asia:

Yunnan province in China. Yes, the whole province. This place gets very little hype in the West, but a lot in China. It's called the 'place where artists go to be inspired.' Go literally anywhere in the province, look forward. If you're not inspired yet, turn around.

Hohhot, Inner Mongolia. This city is crazy beautiful but gets zero hype from anyone. The architecture is an awesome mix of Islamic, Mongolian, and Chinese. If you've ever wondered what it might be like to visit a modern Vaes Dothrak, this is your place.

Gyeongju, SK. The old, old capital of South Korea. Gyeongju is known for its Buddhist temples and artifacts and palace ruins. The mountains around the city have a lot to explore if you're up for it.

Fukuoka, Japan. Man, this place is strange. I wouldn't say there is necessarily a lot to do here, but the city itself is a destination. It is by far the cleanest, most organized place I have ever been -- almost creepily so. It's just something you have to experience even if only for a few days.Agree. Originally thought Hawaii might be to cliche for a honeymoon. Settled on Kauai. Wow. Not overly commercialized. Napali coast, Waimea Canyon, hiking, waterfalls, perfect empty beaches. Just prepare wild chicken 4:30AM wake up calls. We spent a week in Kona (Big Island)...
I expected Hawaii to be beautiful.  

What I didn't expect is just how amazing and how easy it is to see "bucket list" type things.  Want to swim with a sea turtle?  Literally just walk into the water and look down.  Want to see wild dolphins?  Pick a bay and look out in the water.
I also didn't expect just how relaxing a place can be.  Our week in Hawaii was one of the most relaxing weeks in my life.  Everything just felt laid back, even though we were constantly doing "stuff".Boyfriend and i went to Maui a few years ago, also very beautiful!Shoutout to anyone from the 808 reading thisI just got back from Maui two days ago and I'm depressed now.  It was amazing. Prague was awesome, and compared to the rest of Europe, was very cheap!It basically looked like a fairy tale come to life, I highly recommend it during Christmas. The twinkle lights, Christmas markets, and concerts in the castle are something you'll never forget. I like Prague, but holy hell is it touristy. I couldn't walk through Oldtown in the evening without a constant stream of invitations from criers (most of whom were actually American) to go drink at whatever club had hired them. It was exhausting. I was there just last month. It exceeded the hype for me. I stayed there for six days and thought that might be too much, but there's still more in that city that I need to see. As someone who just started photography as a hobby, that city is beautiful and so full of inspiration. I need to go back when my photography skills have improved a bit. Also, my life isn't complete until I get more unpasteurized Pilsner Urquell in me. Gotta love seeing my city here. I'm intensely proud of both my country and it's capital. 

While Lonely Plant and Rough Guides are great, for some supplementary material check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM9_KZNJw8qGuEHJf4lcfIiGwpiRtcKAm) guide. 

TLDR; 

- Watch out for taxi scams and instead use the amazing public transport whenever you can
- Beware of where you exchange money
- There's is more to Prague than the Old Town
- Always be willing to walk a few blocks to eat I'm there right now! Anyone want to get sloshed on palinka?Best city I've ever seen in my life. As an American who grew up traveling all over Europe, I have to say Budapest is still my absolute most favorite city. It has everything! A gorgeous river with ornate bridges,  gothic architecture, colorful doors, amazing food,  and the outskirts even has the forests and beautiful country side.  There is everything to love about Budapest.I'm so excited about going there the week before christmas.Absolutely fell in love with this city! Beautiful architecture on both sides of the river, great and cheap food (heaping plates of meat and potatoes), and cool ruin bars to visit for a fun night out. 

Also worth checking out any one of the thermal baths that are available and experiencing the museum of terror which is incredibly well done. 

But my favorite thing in the whole city was the caves under the palace. You can pay to take a tour of one cave that was excavated years ago and used as a war time hospital in WWII and after. The even have it staged with medical devices from that era. It was a neat peak into the history of the city that I would recommend to everyone. For me Budapest had no hype, since none of my friends who had travelled to Europe (including some whom were very well travelled) had ever been there. It ended up being one of my favorite cities of all time.Srsly one of the best city destinations in Europe imo. Barcelona is an absolute favourite, has everything!Working in NYC, Amsterdam was entirely opposite in every way for a vacation. In a very, very good way.Did you go down to Grand Teton NP? There's a bit less to see/do but IMO the views are among the best in the world. The Tetons are literally breathtaking. Yellowstone seems like a place you go there once when you're a kid, once again when you have kids, and one last time when they take you. Would go back 10/10.Absolutely. Hype is cannon beach mostly from what I heard as coming from the Netherlands. 

Especially the part near Thor’s well is awesome :)Agreed. Petra was cool but Wadi Rum blew my mind. I’d love to go back.Yes! The Petra + Dead Sea as well. I can't say enough about the generosity and hospitality of the Jordan people wow never thought i would see Wadi Rum mentioned in a thread like this. Absolutely beautiful placeIsn't this where a lot of scenes from Lawrence of Arabia were filmed? Absolutely stunning scenery.My photos from wadi rum look fake. That place is so underrated and so so SO breathtakingKyoto always does. But I feel like Osaka deserves some love too.Came here to say this. My god this place was beautiful. 11 days was not enough time.[deleted]>a bit pricey

Understatement of the year here. Switzerland is absolutely beautiful and incredibly charming, but getting there will drain half your walletCan only agree, am Swiss. Some tips:

-If you're using public traffic like trains and your ticket per day is above a certain amount: get a 'GA' for the day, it is often cheaper and you'll have access to ALL public transport (even ferries).

-Avoid Lucerne if you don't like touristey and expensive places.

-Go hiking in the mountains - you'll get the views and if you don't use cablecars its basically free.

-Look for couchsurfing possibilities to save some money, the community is decently active, especially in cities.

PM if you want more tips :)It's one of the best countries in the world, I miss it on a regular basis, from Edinburgh to Inverness to the Orkneys. [removed]If you ever get the chance, try Toroweap on the North Rim, the primitive undeveloped part.  Need high clearance 4wd to get to the edge.  Once there, there is nothing between you and the drop, no wall, fence, chains, nothing.  Exhilarating.I get to live here now, and I gotta say, it's freaking phenomenal.  The canyon never looks the same twice.  Always thought it was kinda meh until I started driving to different points for sunset every night.  And now...

https://imgur.com/a/iq5Rx





This is what I see after dinner lol.

Highly recommend it to anyone journeying through the southwest.  Probably not in summer though.  It's not Phoenix hot, but it's hot!The Grand Canyon didn't just live up to expectations for me; it blew them out of the water. I would go back and I encourage that anyone, no matter who/where they are, go to see the Grand Canyon.Pictures really can't do it justice. Before I went I was like eh... it's a hole in the ground what's the big deal. 

It's like you're looking at a painting. It doesn't even seem real. You really get the existential i'm just a speck of carbon on a giant rock floating through the galaxy vibe when you're standing out over this unthinkably huge void. Highly recommend this for anyone that is on the fence and gets the chance. Thailand is absolutely beautiful. I ended up spending some time there during the "rainy season" but the weather was gorgeous. Best food in the world too.Currently in Chiang Mai. 3rd time to Thailand in the last 18 months. I'm addicted. Send help. Actually don't. Seconded for Maine. I love that state. Everything from Moosehead Lake & Baxter State Park to Bar Harbor & Acadia. 

And coming from NJ, the driving up there is like nothing since you can fly all over the place. Although one time I was heading through Maine due east on Route 2 coming from Mt. Washington and it seemed like every other mile had the road ripped up due to construction, so that trip felt like an eternity just to get to Bangor (and to think I hardly knew her). GOD'S COUNTRY

THE WAY LIFE SHOULD BE

RED HOT DOGS, BLACK FLIES, INSANE HATRED OF TOURISTS AND MASSHOLES

ALSO EVERGREEN TREES AND LOBSTAHSI traveled to Portland this past fall and stumbled upon the [Portland Head Lighthouse](https://c1.staticflickr.com/7/6099/6249278975_85aa221b91_b.jpg) and grabbed the best lobster roll I've ever had there. It was like I stumbled into a stock photo. Cannot recommend Maine enough.I believe it’s also the setting of many Stephen King novels, right? Finally I'm relevant 🙂Can confirm. I’m an European and it felt like walking through the old town where I live. Went to QC for New Years almost a decade ago, I was with a family friend who travelled Europe for years, she said "closest to Europe you can get and still be in North America".  I visited Europe for the first time in my life and immediately agreed with her assesment.I scrolled the comments just to have my city appear, wasn't disappointed hahaBiking around the city was so fun. Something so simple brought me so much joy.But holy hell it's expensive. LOLWanna further explain? Im from Denmark, and would love to hear what your expectations were, and how they were fulfilled.I have never had more delicious pastries in the world than I've had in Denmark. One of my favorite citiesI also enjoyed Aarhus (also Denmark)Spent a week in Manuel Antonio - not a resort town but still safe, pretty, clean, and the rain forests and beaches were STUNNING! I always recommend Costa Rica whenever someone asks for an international place to go.Pura vida tico!something, something, zip lining.. There is a reason many American Ex-pats retire there.As someone who lives near there I avoid Salem during the month of October.Saw the Coliseum yesterday, and the Vatican today. It was the most impressive thing I have ever experienced. A once in a lifetime opportunity. Can agree, if you're into any kind of Ancient History, you have to visit Rome. Also agree about the pickpockets, travelled around many European cities, never been pickpocketed successfully but had by far the most attempts on me on Rome. Strangely enough I was just there for 5 days and had zero pick pocket attempts that I noticed. I was super paranoid about it too.If you enjoy doing all of your daily activities in a sauna, Rome in late July is the place for you!

We stayed in Trastevere and it was the most beautiful little place. A light dinner and wine in the square, surrounded by history and street entertainment. So many vines and potted citrus and cats. I’d love to go back, preferably during a cooler time of year. > And the food is incredible.

If you research first. Don't just walk into any place. The tourist traps were unreal in Rome.Yes...and take that side tour to Pompeii.  Unforgettable.Absolutely agree on London. So many things to see, it has an amazing hustle and bustle to it as well. Loved the tube, everyone was pleasant to talk with, and I never felt unsafe at any point. 

The history behind everything is fascinating and I'm not even that big a of history buff. As a Londoner, I really take for granted that the permanent exhibits in our museums are free. This is so not the case in other major European cities!I loved London as well. I tried my best to not brand myself as a Yankee tourist but even when I opened my mouth and people instantly realized I was from America no one was directly rude. The funniest was one guy bringing up that it was the anniversary of Cornwallis surrendering to Washington. What'd you do while you here? I hear of so many tourists who leave with a bad impression bc they get sucked into all of the tourist traps.

Glad you enjoyed your time. I was just in Paris for the first time about two months ago, and that just wasn't our experience at all with the people. I had about three words of French at my disposal - no exaggeration - and with the exception of a single cab driver who seemed to have a death wish, every single person we encountered was friendly and even patient with us as we tried to clumsily pronounce things. Paris is a big, busy city, kind of like NYC. People are friendly but people are always in a hurry and impatient.Fairly sure that train ride is on Netflix.Is the hole as big as they said it was?My dream is to go snowboarding there somedayYes, Mexico City is really a treasure. Americans don't understand what a remarkable place is waiting only a few hours away by plane. The architecture is what you expect from Spain or Portugal. The food, the music, the liveliness, they're all great.Times Square really isn't that bad getting in and out of. It's worth seeing if you've never seen it before. Sure, it's super touristy, but it's definitely a sight.I heard the Olive Garden is nice there.I'm going to be running The Keys 100-mile race next year. We start in Key Largo and finish in Key West (running over the Seven Mile Bridge somewhere in there). I think the only downside (other than running 100 miles on pavement) is that the race is in May. I'll need to figure out how to train for heat and humidity.My husband and I are planning a road trip to Vermont and back two years from now, and plan on stopping in Chicago both on the way out and on the way back. As a native Chicagoan, I'm happy to hear it!! If you don't mind me asking, what did you do here? A yes, the award winning fjords by Slartibartfast.My fiance and I are going there for our honeymoon at the end of May... Thanks for confirming our choice :)I'm getting married at Sverd i Fjell in May, and I am so fucking excited.  We considered Scotland and Ireland but there just seems something otherworldly about Norway.+1 Bergen is magical.Make sure you go up Table Mountain at the first opportunity. The weather can change radically very quickly and, if it does, the cable car stops working. So, don't wait until your last day there to do it. 

Make sure you go to Boulder Beach to see the penguins!
Other hikes: Lion's head, plenty others just outside of town too

Beaches: boulders (penguins), muizenberg (surfing), clifton/camp's bay (white sand and turquoise ocean), sandy bay (the nudist beach!)

Historical: Robben island (Mandela's prison), Rhodes memorial, various other stuff idk 

Wine farms: any, they're all beautiful. Go to Franschoek or stellenbosch if you have the opportunity. 

Stunning photo opportunities: big bay (beach where you get the best view of the mountain), chapmans peak drive (if it's open), signal hill

Activities: paragliding/skydiving, shark cage diving, squeeze in a visit to a private nature reserve if you want a mini safari.January 5th to 9th. India are playing South Africa in a cricket Test match at Newlands in Cape Town. Great excuse to drink beer for the whole day with a great atmosphere.

I live in Cape Town and it's a beautiful city. I'm sure you will enjoy your trip. All of the places people have suggested are amazing. Please be conscious of water usage when you're here though as we're in the middle of a water crisis / severe drought. Try to stick to the water restriction guidelines. One of my favorite things I've ever done. When I was first in Edinburgh last year, I was morbidly obese, and gave up about halfway up. Didn't tell anyone, but it sucked knowing my weight was affecting my life in such a way. So, I set to it, lost 75 pounds, and had the chance to hike it again on a family vacation this year and it still wasn't easy, but I made it! The views are absolutely incredible and worth every painful second of the hike. That's a pretty standard day weather-wise.Fellow wisconsinite. Have an upvote!

Edit: From SuperiorUW-Superior grad here. We used to day trip to the Dells during summer. And by "day trip", I mean we ate mushrooms and went down water slides. Good times indeed.I got kicked out of those go-karts. 10/10, worth disguising and sneaking back in.Rome doesn't have go-carts; Rome ain't shit!A business associate of mine recently told me after travelling all of the USA that Madison, Wisconsin was his favourite place out of all. Being from the Wet Coast of Canada I can say that I will see your state and spend a good two weeks of my life in your little slice of heaven. Cheers. Cheese curds are truly something you can only really fully experience fresh.My photo of the Cliffs of Moher: https://i.imgur.com/GBL3lHd.jpgthat's a bummer.  :(  We got super lucky with the weather when we went a few months ago.  The day we went to Moher was a bit gray when we arrived, and blue skies by the time we left.  I went on a sunny day in May and someone congratulated me for being present for the entirety of summer. Im Icelandic and it makes me so glad to read comments like this. You get so used to (and bored of) your own country that sometimes you need a reminder like that.They were on last night! I say this to all the tourists I see here, check this website: http://en.vedur.is/. Its the icelandic met office and has an aurora forecast :) Hope you get to see them!
edit: http://en.vedur.is/weather/forecasts/aurora/Yeah grew up on the island, and when I started travelling I was underwhelmed by a lot of places because I took for granted giant forests and mountains all around me.

Def helps for perspective though."Welcome.. to Kaiju Park"

*epic John Williams music*Don’t tell everyone, geez.   Truth. Here is a picture of the sunrise from my barn on the Island. 
[Sunrise](https://imgur.com/gallery/DXB9d) I asked a friend where on Vancouver Island we should go, he said Tofino. We did, it was amazing. Hopefully we'll be back next year.Hey I was born up there! Thanks for the shoutout under the top comment. That was probably around Easter when you played the infamous game of "Eierpecken".Augustinerbräu is awesome. Salzburg is definitely on the top of my list of favorites.I was in Salzburg this past summer, and I also got lost. Unfortunately I ended up in a deserted street, and no fun locals to chat with :( Two summers ago my wife, 6 year old son, and myself spent 6 weeks going through Europe. We started in Scotland, then went through England, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Italy, and then back home to Canada.

The time we spent in Austria we visited Salzburg, then went to Abteneau for a few days. We fell in love with Abtenau. From there we went to a Gasthof just south of Trieben for a few days. I have my private pilot's license and arranged for us to go for a flight from the Trieben airport. We spent an hour in the air flying around the mountains and enjoying the stunning scenery. After that we spent a day in Leoben. I got a haircut in Leoben and from there we took an overnight train to Italy.

I'd love to go back and see Vienna and more of Austria. Initially we had planned to spend more time in Germany, and hadn't planned on really visiting Austria. My wife's ancestry is Italian but she had never been there, so Italy was the big thing on her bucket list. We knew we had to get from Germany to Italy and decided to travel through Austria to get there (since all we heard about Switzerland was how expensive it is). After looking at Austria it ended up becoming more and more interesting and looked like such a nice place, so we started carving days out of other parts of the trip to be able to spend more time in Austria, and I'm glad we did. You have a beautiful country.

* edit: accidentally typed Sweden when I meant to type SwitzerlandYop - October through November I stayed in bad gastein for $900 35 days in two bedroom apartment with heated floors big balcony windows, a shower that was the whole room, jacuzzi tub and a spa but nobody would travel up the hill to I️t unless you had a car so most other tourists stuck to the ski resort

With my girlfriend, the best memory I have to date
Anywhere in Salzkammergut (near-salzburg) is just jaw dropping unreal, beautiful cabins, cows, CLEAR lakes, ground hogs, so much beer 
https://i.imgur.com/hgkTrUu.jpg

Here’s the Airbnb but the problem is I went in the OFF-SEASON like this guy explained - skiing season I️t is very expensive like $2000 a month I think?

https://abnb.me/EVmg/mtDlPuXYrIOctober and November are my times to travel because of my seasonal job. It's great because it's the off season for so many magical placesYou put it into words!! Vienna is what people think Paris is like. I've been to both and I vastly preferred Vienna, no contest. The underground system there is also easier to navigate than D.C. even though everything is in German. Everyone was so incredibly kind, even though I spoke next to no German and sometimes they spoke next to no English. Austria was a 10/10, would absolutely visit again. Paris, on the other hand... I'm fairly certain Parisians feed on the weak. Same here. If I strike it rich the first thing I’m doing is going to Vienna.I loved the north island. Auckland was a great hub for excursions, and easy to get around in, plus some great islands to visit. I live in the North Island, but have never been to the South.. I should probably change that sometime soon.Third this, my wife and I honeymooned on the North Island last year during NZ fall. We've both been wanting to go since watching LOTR. So of course we went to Hobbiton and the touristy stuff on top of traveling down country and enjoying the spectacular scenery and hospitality of the Kiwis. The rest of our time was spent in Auckland and up north and island hopping. During our travels we made friends that we still keep in touch with. We fell in love with the country and people so much that we are actively looking to move there permanently. 

Our next trip is going to be Christchurch and a  South Island excursion for sure. Can't wait to go back.The town near Pukaki was probably Tekapo (next to its own lake), or Twizel. That whole area is really nice.I too grew up in Northern Arizona. Yes, it's beautiful, but it's mostly rocks and sunsets doing all the work. Went to the Gorge in Oregon, was stunned and speechless. Went to the Scottish Highlands, and really lost my shit. That place is the titsPlease try to get to Coromandel (North Island), go surf casting off any of the beaches, and visit Cathedral Cove and Hot Water Beach. Google CC and you’ll see why.If it hasn’t been said yet then come see the glow worm caves. It’s like an alien experience. From a Kiwi - A couple of spots off the standard tourist tail. 

Raglan is one of the most beautiful, relaxed wee towns and it has one of the most amazing  point breaks in the world. Even if you're not a surfer, go sit down on the grass with everyone else and watch the locals go at it. 

And, no one ever heads through New Plymouth, but if you can, go check it out. It's stunning.

Get some Six-60, Kora and Concord Dawn on your phone for the flight over, to start getting you ready for the Kiwi vibe.

Have a chat to the locals when you get here and ask advice from anyone. You'll find almost everyone happy to help and to give you your time, especially outside the main centres (but even most of us Aucklanders are bloody lovely people and will stop whatever we're rushing around for to help out a tourist in need).

Finally, welcome to our little slice of paradise and I hope you have a cracking stay! Your roads are amazing compared to Pennsylvania roads. My friend's grandma from Cali died while hiking. She was NINETY FUCKING NINE YEARS OLD! Pictures of her at her funeral were confusing. I was was like "Oh, was this when she was in her early 60's?" And they were like "That was 2 months before she died". She didn't tell anyone she was going out. She was found with a smile on her face. She knew exactly what she was doing. I am crying again. Being from Indiana and loving our parks, it almost makes me afraid to visit the really nice, famous parks, lolMight be the obnoxious crowds.I only had a day to spend in Athens because we were leaving for a week in Mykonos the next morning, but I'd honestly would've rather spent that entire week in Athens.

While I did find Athens to be quite grimy, dirty, and I was neither a fan of the Somali scammers nor the gangs of gypsy kids, the city itself was bursting with places to see and things to do. I would've loved to see all the historical neighbourhoods, monuments, galleries, museums etc. Restaurants, bars, and all that jazz looked wonderful as well, and reasonably priced for the most part. The locals were all extremely friendly and willing to help out. 

By contrast on Mykonos it felt like you really had to be careful not to get ripped off.

Only other complaint was that the taxi driver on the way back to our accommodation got lost and then wanted us to pay the full fucking price of like €10 after driving around in circles for like 20 minutes. I gave him €5 (price we agreed upon beforehand) and left quite enraged. Northern Greece is also pretty nice too (Greek/Aussie who lived in Greece for three years), I was up in Thessaloniki and Kavala and loved it.One of our cab drivers told us to get to the islands as quick as we could. He said that the city was only built for a max of 400,000 people or so and they’re up in the millions now. It’s crowded, lots of traffic and lots of petty crime. Thanks for visiting b'ys!I'm loving reading this thread on the mighty Newfy's! 
My little story was arriving in St Johns one night after a long drive with another backpacker looking for the youth hostel.
It was early 2000's and the only reference we had of where it was located was an old telephone book. We arrived at the address, it didn't look right but the front door was open. I walked up the stairs and a man was just sitting on his couch watching TV. I asked if it was the hostel, he laughed and said 'about five year ago it was, where are you from?' I told him I was an Australian and my friend was from Switzerland. He was genuinely exited, invited us in for a rum and we ended up sleeping drunk on the couch. AmazingI really liked the Irish people. I found them to be genuine, dry in their humor and all around good people. I'd easily join an Irish family.Agree 100%. Went for the first time last year for two weeks, and I've been back three separate times since. The Burren was one of my favorite places I've ever been, just an utterly bizarre contrast with every other part of Ireland I had seen, plus nights out in Galway are amazing. Already planning my next trip, hoping to get a cottage on the Atlantic coast and just relax for a week or two. I'm starting a job next week that will involve a lot of travel to Ireland and Australia.

Thanks for making me even happier with my decision.I love the Burren! The Perfumery is one of my favorite places. Ailwee Cave was surprisingly awesome, definitely make time for the Birds of Prey show, I got to hold a Barn Owl! 

I tell everyone who visits to do the Ring of Dingle, it's spectacular and less known. Check our Conor's Pass, it's literally breathtaking.Just did a week in Ireland (thanksgiving break). We rented a car and stayed two nights each in Dublin, Kilkenny, Galway and then back in Dublin. I think Glendalough was my favorite, followed closely by our drive West/North out of Galway through Connemara and the Sky road. Unbelievable scenery. Sounds like someone has never been to Coppers.From Australia myself and that was the big difference I noticed when in the States. All of the guys there are posturing in bars and such.

Just get a pint and shut up, ya cunt. Weeeellll...I think the mistake people are making here is failing to distinguish between pubs and bars/clubs.  The clubs (and club-like bars) in the U.K. and Ireland are just as bad when it comes to this.>
>the driver was alive during the troubles 

Just so you know, the Good Friday agreement was 1998, and the IRA ceasefire 1994. I think people tend to think it was a much longer time ago than in reality. I'm 23 and can remember British soldiers patrolling my street fully armed. As a Northern Irishman It makes me sad that this distinction had to be made. We're as Irish as anyone on this island. Glad you enjoyed it. Yeah. It's then reeeeeeeally awkward when we go abroad and make a joke and everyone looks at you like you just pissed in their cornflakes.Exactly and no (or very few) TVs. It took a while to figure out why it felt so different. It was because most of the noise was just the buzz of people talking and laughing.When I first left Ireland I presumed all butter tasted like ours. By God I was wrong.Jayzus this thread is going to give us all a serious ego. Once you're over 16 you can get served (quietly) in a bar, so long as someone else buys.

Just don't get yourself noticed.Seriously! This whole thread is making me want to pack up and travel!
Bringing my German exchange student to a Johnstown, New York KFC was...something 

"Why do zhey eat zheir food in camouflasch?"

I don't know, Kevin. I don't know. 

Why a small town one? Are they bigger for smaller places..?What time of year would you recommend a traveler going?We also have a lot of roads which are so narrow that they don't have a left or right side and are ruled by random sheep who decide if they'll let you continue. Kauai is ridiculously cliched in the best possible way. I swam with sea turtles, seals were hanging out on the beach, there were rainbows every day, great food and some of the most beautiful scenery I've ever seen. It's crazy.

I had the same experience.  So many things to do and see, and EAT!

OMG Poke

OMG Shave ice

OMG spam masubi

OMG Snorkeling 

OMG OMGJust got back from the big island. I went snorkeling in water containing countless tropical fish where my only point of reference was recognizing some of them from Finding Nemo. Swam near turtles. Stood on black sand beaches and watched turtles make their way out to the ocean.

None of this was any sort of organized tour. We saw a sign for a beach, we parked the car, and got in the water. It's the norm there. It was a blast.I can second Maui.  Thought it'd be cliche.  Fucking beautiful place.  Lots of places to just go off and snorkel.Howzit braddahIf you want another cheap European vacation go to Poland! It's even cheaper than Prague and I thought the people were a lot friendlier. There's a ton to do pretty much anywhere you go in the country, and the food is amazing, and SO CHEAP. We had a delicious 3 course dinner, with wine and dessert at a restaurant on the outskirts of Warsaw and it was like 20$ a person. (EDIT: i know a lot of meals can be had for 20$ or less, but a comparable meal in my city would have easily been 100$ per person, so I was impressed by the affordability!)>	It basically looked like a fairy tale come to life

Tell them about the alcoves...There is a ton to do in Prague outside of Oldtown. If you learn the subway system (very easy), you can go anywhere in the city and see a lot of less touristy areas. Also a day pass for every single train and subway costs about $3-4. 

Vysehrad, Karlin, and farmer markets are pretty fun. Only that one bit from Old Town to Charles Bridge to Castle. Everything else is pretty quiet. 

And there's no reason to be in the Old Town in the evening, it's hideously over-priced. Go a couple of streets back in any direction and the price drops like a stone.I had 7 days planned in Prague, 3, then to Amsterdam for 3, then back to Prague for 4 before going on to Moscow and then back to South Korea where I was living.

I had just spent something like 7-10 days in Spain where I rented a car and literally drove all over the place. Was a lot of fun but exhausting. Wake up each morning and do a little exploring, jump in the car for a few hours of exploring, get to a new city around dinner, rinse and repeat. 

We had no plans in Spain, or reservations, so we arrived in Prague in a similar position and found a big board in the airport advertising apartments to rent. One was right downtown (two or three blocks from the big cuckoo clock) and was only like 150euro a night, but had a laundry room, etc. We called the guy up, and he happened to be on his way to the airport to pick someone else up and told us the place was ours. He also agreed we could reserve it after we got back from Amsterdam and that since we were staying so many nights he'd knock the price down and taxi us back and forth from the airport. Cool.

We get in and there is a little restaurant on the ground floor a few doors down. Prague is literally like a fairytale just walking down the street, but we started going to this place once a day, and they served one of the best steaks I'd ever eaten. So for three days we just hung out and on the third day we became friendly with one of the waiters who invited us out with his friends. We went to this underground bar (not under the ground, but low key invite only not exactly legal) where they had guys serving drinks who were performing by throwing bottles up in the air, live music, etc.

We were pretty blown away by how surreal it was. Every day having no agenda, just wandering the city and eating, shopping, wandering in and out of old buildings. The people were so much more accepting than they were in Spain. We felt welcomed and had hung out at this waiters house earlier in the day when he gave me a bag of weed for free. 

Right on the spot I decided we weren't going to Amsterdam. We had non-refundable tickets but no hotel reservations, and I told the waiter who got really excited and asked if I was serious. I took a shot and then loudly said, "FUCK AMSTERDAM! I'M STAYING IN PRAGUE!'

That went over pretty well. Didn't pay for another drink the entire night. Everyone cheered. Later we went back to the restaurant (which was closed) to drink at the bar after hours. We were standing on the street smoking a joint and I saw some cops walking towards us on the opposite side. I got paranoid and started trying to conceal what we were doing and get the group of locals back into the bar. The waiter saw I was anxious and asked why, to which I stated the obvious, that we were smoking weed in public, which was illegal, and that cops were walking towards us. 

He put his middle finger up in the air and said, "FUCK THE POLICE!" I seriously almost shit myself but later he told me something like, "Look, we lived under Soviet oppression for decades, we don't take shit from the cops like you do in America. They weren't going to fuck with us."

Trying to make a long story short we ended up renting a car and driving to the waiter's home town. His mom cooked stroganoff from scratch for us, we went skiing at this backwoods podunk place and got hammered with his childhood friends who then took us bowling at this completely strange 1980s discotheque which looked like even when it was built that it was horribly out of fashion. We drove into Germany to have lunch one day and then went back to Prague where we continued to simply walk around and eat and actually relax during a vacation.

The most favorite city I have ever been to.  
I live here, if you want :DD

Btw the party district is in the 7th district around the Wesselényi street, Teréz boulevard, and Dohány street synagouge.Now if only it was possible to learn Hungarian Go to a bar called Szimpla Kert! I visited a few months ago and it's one of the coolest bars I've ever been toAs an Oregonian, it shocks me that people in the Netherlands are talking about a small beach town I grew up going to on the coast.I loved Cape Perpetua. I could've spent a week sitting there watching the ocean. As a whole for my trip; I enjoyed Osaka the most. I felt like there was more to do in terms of sightseeing compared to Tokyo. Kyoto was so beautiful and peaceful. People even seemed more relaxed as they sat by the river. The polar opposite of Tokyo. /r/japanpics can help fill the void of what you missed out on.Five and a half years wasn't enough either. Idk $15 doesnt sound so badI tell everyone I hear going to Europe: drive through Switzerland, see the sights, maybe bike or hike it...

Do not stay there for any substantial period of time. You’ll spend more in that one country than on the rest of your trip. If you want a cheaper alternative, try Austria, particularly Tyrol and Vorarlberg. The views are just as amazing and everything is half the price.I absolutely loved Lucerne when I went there. It might have been because im a tourist though.Lucerne is sooo beautiful though Technically you can get that experience from a lot of the south rim too.  Just hike out to Shoshone point, for example.I worked there for 9 months last year. Living there sucked, but being able to go out to the rim whenever I wanted to was worth it.Mango sticky rice!***DOWNEAST PRIDE: ACTIVATED***

Portland? You didn't see Maine. You saw northern Massachusetts.

***DOWNEAST PRIDE: DEACTIVATED***

Come on down to Machias and see the real Maine! The meth's on us!Stephen King took the *write what you know* mantra to heart, so in ~~most~~ **all** of his stories, the protagonist is a writer in Maine.I live there.
Fuck me.

Edit: Not literally you grapes. Plus, I look like a burnt chicken nugget so I don’t think you’ll want to.My expectations were high. Anthony Bourdain, among many others, made it out to seem like a magical place. Upon my arrival, I was not disappointed. I arrived on what I was told to be one of the most gorgeous days of weather that Copenhagen had seen that year. The four days I was there continued this trend with some of the coziest nights and most beautiful days I had ever seen. The food was tasty, the people were consistently glowing with gorgeous smiles, the architecture was awe-inspiring and lovely to look at, and the birds even seemed to be welcoming me with music.

The intricate bicycle system is intuitive and friendly. Pub transportation was inviting and simple. The canals were romantic and fascinating. And I made some of the best of friends I could ever imagine. The city and it's way of life is ideal for someone like me and I couldn't help but feel like I had been pleasantly trapped inside a Disney movie. 

I definitely over-romanticize the place but goddamn, what a happy time it was. 

What is your take on the city and the country? Would love to know how ridiculous I sound to you! Yea haha my buddy was like wanna go up to Salem this weekend in October and I was like are you fucking serious? I've obviously been a few times but it's not a trip on a whim you gotta plan for it and commit to it or else you'll turn around as soon as you get thereBe sure to go into St. Peters Cathedral! You can also go on top of it and get the best view of rome.Did you get the voice of god in the Sistine Chapel?

When we were there, about every 5 minutes you would hear over the PA system "SILENCE, shhhhhhhhh"Pickpockets will go for the easiest looking target, so if you looked like you were constantly on the alert, that might be why. I had my hand on my purse with my thumb hooked through the leather piece of my zipper any time I walked anywhere. Totally agree with London. It's the first place I've ever went to on vacation where *I really didn't want to go back home again*. 

The tube, the trains, the hustle and bustle, thousands of years of history, buildings named the 'the gerkin', and 'walkie talkie'. Just everything was amazing. 

If things turn out, will be headed back again next fall.> Everyone was pleasant to talk with

THANK YOU. As someone from Essex who goes into London often, I do not get the idea that "all Londoners are rude, uptight shitbags". They're just like all other Brits, many are great, some are cunts. Exactly. Being able to say "bonjour", "s'il vous plaît", "merci" and "parlez-vous anglais ?" can make or break your stay in France since formal politeness is extremely important here. People tend to interpret anything and everything as a "fuck off" in Paris because they're constantly told people are unfriendly there. There are some cold waiters sometimes, but it's the same in every country. Plus people are actually excited when someone makes the effort of speaking French because it's very rare. But the myth has to live on!Taking a cab in Paris is unnecessary. I’ve done it once in over a year cumulatively spent in Paris. You’re never more than 500m from a metro station and during times where the metro was not operating, I’d ride a Vélib across town. There’s almost nowhere in Paris you can’t bike to in half an hour. Basically they just want to see you at least attempt to speak their language so they know you respect their culture even if you aren't fluent.That was our experience too - the people we met in Paris were almost all friendly and very understanding with our clumsy attempts at communication. I think the experience is what you make it, and being polite as a guest goes a long way.I just want to drop into Corbet's Couilar.Agreed. It's a spectacle. Don't spend all your time there (and DEFINITELY don't eat there), but if you've never been to NYC, check it out at least once. Especially at night. Wait til you go to the Sbarro's there. The only place you can grab a real NY slice.I was with a tour group, so a lot of typical touristy stuff. The Bean, Sears Tower, a river cruise about the architecture,  Field Musuem. Ate at Billy Goat Tavern.  Walked around exploring the sights.   I didn't realize a Chicago was so big, so I'd love to go back and explore it some more :)Slartibartfast is always my next thought when I hear the word fjord.End of May? I hope you scheduled it so you get to experience the national day on the 17th, it's awesome. Everyone dresses up in the national costume, there's parades, marching bands, you eat hot dogs, cotton candy, ice cream... My favorite holiday. Words and pictures can't do it justice, it's unbelievable!  Enjoy!Kayaking with penguins was awesome! They're so awkward on land but so fast in water, and they'll pop up right next to your boat to say hi. I loved that shitNow you'll just have to use it as an excuse to go every couple years!Yo not gonna lie that's super inspirational. I actually just did the climb about a month ago while travelling and luckily I've never been troubled with weight issues, but even for both my fit friend and I it was a relatively tough climb. Mad respect for seeing a change you needed to make and getting it done, especially because the views are so worth it :)As somebody whos been dieting since late August (went from 106 Kilos to 93, going for about 80-85), stories like yours are part of what keeps me going! Never stop posting them! You people are heroes and deserve every bit of praise! *squeak*You might be wondering, how do we contain the kaiju? 

*epic guitar riffs* 
Enter the jaegers. Everyone already knows, check the real estateYup! Was there the week before Easter, and I actually won one of the rounds. I have tried teaching it to my friends back here, but I think I don't boil my eggs hard enough. > Eierpecken

Interesting! Us Greeks have this as well.Awesome, i've never met someone who (as a tourist) spent time in Leoben. 

Abtenau and Trieben are really beautiful.

Your whole trip sounds awesome

Glad you enjoyed your stay. How'd you find a place like this? I'm travelling in Europe at the moment and would love to find something cheaper than AirBnB...[deleted]Paris is special. It's a smelly, dirty shithole yet I love it so much.As a Canadian who married an Austrian, I actually find Vienna pretty cheap. The immigration is painful, but it's cheaper for me than the East Coast of Canada. Rent for a small apartment can be around 400€, beer is 80c. A can in the stores, local cheese and bread is cheap. You can be in a different country in less than an hour by bus or train. It's amazing and less expensive than people think.Came here to say North New Zealand. Was overwhelmed by all the different beauties. Coromandel Peninsula was unbelievable.  Come down here, it’s so beautiful. Milford sound is my top rated place, it’s freakin magical. Bro, I had never been to the south island until like a year ago. I'm a Hamilton local. Finally made it there. We're missing out. It's fucking sick I thought the Scottish Highlands were great, but unfortunately they happened to be having a historic heat wave the week I visited, so everything was 90F and sunny, which I think kind of undermined the full effect.This! I was at Wai-o-tomo a few weeks ago, Blackwater Rafting is one of the best things I've done in my life! Can't forget Fat Freddies Drop eitherA dirt road is amazing compared to Pennsylvania roads. The infrastructure here is terribleThats so beautiful!What parks are good around here? I've only ever been to Turkey RunGotta get out of the Valley :)Get on a trail, any trail after a mile will have barely any people. Mykonos is probably bar-none the worst Greek island one can visit.Athens is pretty awesome, but like the other guy said you only need 1-2 days there. The Acropolis is crowded but still cool. If you can get a good view of it at night time, it is lit up and looks pretty amazing. It was you Islanders that made my visit there great.  Our trailer had a breakdown, and I swear half the island came out to help.  Including people with hot soup to warm up the crowd!  It was a day that went from bad to almost fun.  A great trip story that I love to tell.An odd marriage proposal, but it it works for you....You will have to bring your own booze.I know a few Irish people who now live here in Australia and now that you've mentioned it, they are all very much like this. One of them I got to work with for about a year and I don't think there was ever a dull moment. Galway is awesome. One night when I stumbled out of a pub at 10 PM to watch the sunset, I started talking with one of the locals. He told me that Galway is the "killer of dreams." He said that ambitious young men flock to Galway for higher education, but then fall in love with the city and never leave. They find a life of contentment in Galway, and anything else becomes superfluousMe and my husband did a babymoon in Ireland, and I did all of the research for the trip (as I typically do for any trips we take since I'm the planner in the relationship).  I tried to explain The Burren to him based on what I read about it, but all I could tell him is "I don't know, it's supposed to be this really cool geosite".  And we saw it, and we now try to explain to people how cool it was, and our explanation really isn't much different now that we've seen it.  But honestly it was one of the neatest things we experienced along with the Cliffs of Moher (which we coincidently saw on the same day due to location, that was definitely our favorite day of the week long trip).Oh god don’t send the tourists there! Our reputation will be ruined! RUINED I TELLS YA!God i fucking love that placeFrom Belgium myself and that was the big difference I noticed when in the States. All of the guys there are posturing in bars and such.

Zuipt gewoon uw pintje leeg en zwijgt, onnozelen hannes.

From the US myself and... BRO ARE YOU TALKING TO MY GIRLFRIEND ILL KICK YOUR ASS, CANT YOU SEE MY TAPOUT SHIRT YOU SKINNY BITCHThis is true even more so outside of the cities. Try it in inner city Dublin and you won't even get through the door.

I was at a relative's 50th birthday at a hotel in the country somewhere, I think maybe Waterford, when I was 15. They served me no problem.They think they are hunting.Not sure if this is what OP is getting at, but AFAIK in a lot of small towns Walmart is the only store, and so yes sometimes they are much bigger.  They’ve actually completely dominated and destroyed their competition. As they’re the only game in town, they have everything and everyone, which can be quite a sight.In a small town you usually have maybe two, usually one main streets with little shops on them. There will be an "authentic" Mexican place, a "Chinese" place that is horrible and not actually Chinese food and a mom & pop restaurant that has horribly bland food with an average patron age of 147. The shops will be so small and specific that you wonder how they make it. (the rent is low and they might have second jobs). You will see a Dollar store, two thrift stores, 2 shitty gas stations and a good gas station, 2 liquor stores, a private grocery store that doesn't have much and closes at 8. There will also be a hardware store and at least one bar. 

Wal-Mart is like the god damn town center. When you go there you see your neighbors, Tim and Erica who you see at church every once in a while and no less than two people you went to school with. They have pretty much everything you need including groceries that are cheaper and better than the private grocers, hardware cheaper than the hardware store and everything else you would imagine to find at a walmart. The store is clean and usually people are happy and friendly and nobody is really in a rush. This is much unlike a metro Wal-Mart where people are unruly, nobody cares about how the store looks, workers are angry at their life choices. etc etc. I'm not that guy, but early-/mid-Summer before the festival season is a nice time for Edinburgh (or *during* the festival season if you're into a buttload of festivals). Not as crowded (but still crowded; it's Edinburgh), light until 11 PM or so, and the rain is lovely and warm. Warsaw is on the expensive end of Poland.

Go to Krakow or Gdansk (both better looking cities too) and you'll have an even better experience.An astonishing percentage of Poles speak English and are delighted to have an opportunity to get to use their skills with an authentic English speaker. You just won't find a more friendly and hospitable people than the Poles. And yes, the food and dining experience is heavenly.Krakow was also wonderful, but some places were aggressively and surprisingly touristy. Still, it was amazing paying less than 2 euros for a pint of beer in Poland, when I'm used to French prices where 5 euros is considered a steal. Funny story from Prague- We get in off a train and get a cab.  The driver is Middle Eastern, came to Europe recently.  He's talking about how great Prague is.  Only problem, he says, "It is so expensive here."  He asks where we came from, and my Dad says Switzerland.  The taxi driver laughs. "Then Prague is cheap! Very cheap!"It is especially this year. A popular dutch tv show, last years season, was recorded in Oregon. It included Portland, Cannon Beach, Painted Hills, Pendleton and more. Dutch tourism to there has skyrocketed since. 

But yeah, its a pretty iconic beach, so we know about it. Also the near Astoria for obvious reasonsI think Osaka is very underrated, especially when compared to Tokyo. But like you said, much more to see and do. While Tokyo is incredible, it can very overwhelming. I enjoyed the sight seeing in Osaka more and liked the fact that Kobe, Kyoto and Nara are close by.That'd only make me miss that fucking place more. One year was not enough :(Mr. Rich guy over here with $30.00 in his wallet.I lived there for a couple of months last year and was riding a bike. Bike hit a bump in the rain, I flew off the bike, landed on my hand. Thought there's a chance it could be fractured. So I went to a hand specialist in a big city and he and his swiss-german speaking teammmate examined my hand. I've never seen cutting edge medical technology used before. In the U.S. they take you to an x-ray room and take x-ray pictures.  Here the doctor takes a scanner and moves it up and down your hand, and he sees a real-time image on the screen, and it's very sharp.  Turns out, no fractures, but they gave me a brace and medication.  
Cost: $440 USD for that one visit.Lol the only "Downeast" you want to see is Acadia and Bar Harbor. You venture any more East than that. You can manage some nice views, but you're in some *Hills Have Eyes* type of area (Sorry true Downeasters)And sometimes the writer is even named Stephen King.>Fuck me.

all right but that'll be $50My understanding is that wages are proportionately high as well? Not true?NO PHOTO! NO VIDEO! SILENZIO!!As a Londoner - I sometimes am just awe struck when I discover some new piece of architecture or some iconic ancient building that I just never saw before . Was walking  near museum of London and suddenly looked up and saw parts of London’s original wall - protected for all to see . 

Incredible It's mostly because it's busy and people that work there just get frustrated with tourists standing right outside tube entrances, or being slow.

But that's all part of the fun of London.I started every conversation with "Bonjour...Parlez-vous anglais?" very politely, and everybody was amazing there. I had less success (though the people were still amazing) in little towns in Provance, but that was just because they answered "Non," and I had to do a lot of gesturing and pointing. Also, menus were hard.even better, go there at 3-4AM when there's nobody there.

it's absolutely surreal seeing these few blocks lit up like a hundred suns but not a soul is there.I always like to come to New York a little bit early so I can hit a few of my favorite haunts, like right here...Chicago is my favorite US city I've been to. Maybe favorite ever actually. And I did all the touristy stuff too and just loved it. Also Pequods is amazing. Bless you for still calling it the Sears Tower...Followed by fiddly bitsIt'd be like a Rocky montage but instead of over a few weeks, it'd be over a few years.Tonight, we are cancelling a boring vacation! Kaiju...uhhhh.... finds a wayThe trip started by returning my wife's grandmother's ashes to Yorkshire. My wife and I had been together for 20 years and had never taken a vacation anywhere, unless you count a couple of weekends in Ottawa. We never really had the money for a vacation.

We had started to get together a bit of savings and figured that since we would be travelling all the way across the ocean, and since we'd never really taken a trip, we'd go big, make it a trip of a lifetime.You get them 1.) outside the city metro line where all the tourists are 2.) rent for a month at a time so you get like 40% off on Airbnb and 3.) stay In suburbs of major cities and just take the train when you feel like being a tourist. But even for a few days at a time I always found great prices on Airbnb I️t was cheaper cost of living than my apartment in Phoenix

An Austrian girlfriend also helps because you can buy a car in her name and sell it when you’re done. We traveled for a yearYou live there now? What's it like taking your life and moving it to a whole new place with new people anda  new language?The Bay of Islands further north is amazing tooI’m a proud New Zealander and I’m glad you guys enjoyed it! We’re very proud of our country :)New York on the 90: nice and smooth (save for the area on the reservation)

Pennsylvania on the 90: ohgodbumpyimgonnagetaconcussion 

Ohio on the 90: nice and smooth"I've seen smoother mine fields before" --People after driving an hour in PA during the spring.Turkey Run is great! I'd recommend checking out Brown County and Pokagon State Park. Pokagon in the winter especially.Turkey Run is kind of the holy grail of Indiana parks, getting better than that as a whole is tough, but there are a lot of gems. Examples are coming to mind but it really depends on what part of the state you're in. My favorites are all nearby where I live (primarily because they're close and I've had an opportunity to really get to know them), so I'm not going to rattle all those off ;)

For example, up north Tippecanoe River State Park is supposedly great (I've only heard, haven't actually been, not as familiar with the northern parks). In central Indiana there's Turkey Run, of course, and downtown Indy/near 465 has a bunch of cool areas like Holliday park and Eagle Creek. In Southern Indiana, there are a treasure trove of smaller but beautiful parks in Monroe and Brown county. Hoosier National Forest and Brown County State Park are both phenomenal. Lake Monroe is the largest and (imo) most beautiful lake in the state, in BCSP. Patoka Lake is also gorgeous (and quite large) in the HNF.

Without knowing what's closer to you, I think that's the best list I can give. Really if you just Google search for parks nearby, they mostly should have decent pictures and can give you an idea of what's worth visiting.Or go in winter. It’s gorgeous.Isn't it more of a "party" place? We stayed in Santorini for 5 days and have 0 regrets.  Yup, same with the folks that I know back in the States. 

And this is in comparison to a country like Thailand. Where it's called the "land of smiles" but they're not genuine smiles. It's the land of "Do you want to buy my item? No? okay, fuck you." And I get it. The place lives on tourism, especially compared to a place like Dublin. But even those who lived for tourism there, it was more like..."this is Ireland, it's not perfect, but it's my home. And if you don't like it. well fuck off."What the fuck is a babymoon?From America myself and I don't understand what you said so I feel threatened and am about to get belligerent becAUSE IF YOU THINK YOU CAN TALK SHIT ABOUT THE TROOPS THEN BUDDY YOU GOT ANOTHER THING COMING I DON'T CARE WHAT PART OF FRANCE YOUR FROM HERE WE SPEAK ONE LANGUAGE AND THE TROOPS FOUGHT FOR YOUR RIGHT TO SPEAK ENGLISH GOD BLESS THE USAI hope I stay married, I wouldn't last in this culture.  Yup - from a small town that has the Super WalMart serving a few counties. Everyone goes to WalMart on Sunday after Church. Everyone.When my small hometown upgraded from a Walmart to a SuperWalmart, it was a huge event for the grand opening. I don't remember everything that happened (I wasn't there for the big excitement), but I know there was a concert and that people skipped school to be there.

I haven't lived there in 10 years now. Can't say I miss it.> the rain is lovely and warm

That's basically Scotlands version of great weather.I will be very soon in Wroclaw for sometime. Anything I should keep in mind or look forward to?

Edit: All you responders are so kind. Thanks.I don't know, the food in Warsaw was.. fine. Maybe we went to the wrong places, but I was pretty disappointed from the restaurants - and in one place, when I asked the waiter what he recommends he was embarrassed and didn't want to answer me in case I don't like it What parts of Osaka would you recommend? I'm headed there in a few months.Oh, check out this fatcat implying he owns a wallet.Wow. I went to the ER in Utah cause I got pink eye while on a trip. The drops cost me over $500. Fucking. Eyedrops.This guy Downeasts.

Once you get east of Gouldsboro it can get pretty ***edit***~~Warren~~Ned-Beatty-in-Deliverance...not that Ellsworth is exactly a cultural mecca itself.Thats a bargain!I seriously doubt that there's ever *any* time of day when there'd be "not a soul," but it'll at least be a bit less crowded at 3am (I think 4am is when the commuter trains start coming running, though). Depending on the day.I love later when he gets lost and points to the river and says "That's either the Hudson or the East." because aren't they on opposite sides of Manhattan? WAIT, WE FORGOT KEVIN!sorry about your loss but something great came out of it. MFW I have a wife who won't let me get an Austrian girlfriend...Difficult, interesting, and useful. 

I moved here because I met a wonderful woman from here. 

The immigration aspects are difficult. The whole legal process probably took 8 months and cost about 2-3000 euros. Parts of adapting to small cultural things can be hard, things like traffic rules or being polite are not always intuitive.

The language is a little difficult, but it's a million times earlier to learn a language when you're surrounded by it. You learn some phrases about, say, the subway. The next day you hear the P.A announce the next stop and it's a phrase you learned. It reinforces it way more.

People I meet through work and my wife, found some people who share my hobbies, or other expats.

All in all a rewarding experience overall so far.Meanwhile on I-76

Pennsylvania: nice and smooth (save for Lancaster to KOP and driving through South Philly)

Ohio: this shit has been under construction for the last 15 years

They just repaved from KOP to City Ave on I-76 in PA so it's all nice and smooth.. for nowThis. Go in winter and you basically have the park to yourself, plus the snow on the trees is gorgeous.Mykonos is basically a collection of nightclubs trying to imitate ibiza, it's horrible, very much a party place. Those who've only visited Mykonos don't realise how much they overcharge for everything compared to literally *any* other place in Greece.


Santorini is for sure one of the best ones, even if it's a bit touristy for most Greeks. I work for one of the biggest tourist companies in Ireland and the "This is Ireland, it's not perfect but it's my home. If you don't like it, fuck off" attitude is the attitude of everyone I work with. 

We do our job and just want you to have a good time, at the end of the day, I love my home even if it's a bit shite at times. Like an adult moon except smallerI have over 300 confirmed barfightsCanadian here, well said.

Sorry to the others..."It’s fine Scottish weather we’re having. The rain is falling straight down and kind of to the side like."Look forward to cheap booze and amazingly beautiful people. You're going to have a great time!Warsaw is a shit place to go, and I'm saying this as a pole. It might be a capital but it's not a nice or interesting place to go to. Go to Krakow instead I really liked Nara, it's technically not in Osaka, but a 30-45 minute train ride away. It's famous for the deer park, there is a big part of the town where there are literally deer wandering around, they are pretty docile and you can buy special biscuits to feed them, also if you bow to them they will bow back (you should give them a biscuit as a reward for this). 

Even if you don't care about the deer the whole area is very scenic, there are loads of temples and shrines to explore, and the whole area has forest around it (nice break from the treelessness of Tokyo). It was a humid, crowded, overcast day when I went to Nara and I still loved it, I highly recommend going there during good weather.

Also /r/japantravel (READ THE FAQ BEFORE POSTING) was very helpful to me.I keep MY lentils in my pocket!'MERICUHKaiju slips on a a marbleI know you mean Kevin from Home Alone but it's funnier if you imagine the Reddit meme Kevin in that situationThank you for your kind words.

Nana had lived a pretty amazing life, she lived to be 90. She was in England during WWII, worked for the RAF, then moved to Canada. She lived long enough to become a great-grandmother to our son (we never thought we would be able to have children so it was wonderful she was still with us when he was born).>  being polite

Did you really move to Vienna?Meanwhile on the Sckuylkill Expressway portion of 76: Very smooth...almost unnaturally smooth...Because you aren't moving.What's one island that's top of the chart but not too touristy? i'm going next year and would love to know more!I went to a huge mall in Krakow and everyone looked like models. Not just because of their bodies, but they all looked like they were wearing outfits worth a pretty penny.Is Krakow named after thunder?>also if you bow to them they will bow back (you should give them a biscuit as a reward for this). 

...and if you don't give them a biscuit fast enough, they *will* start nipping at you to remind you they're hungry, and it *will* bruise.

Totally worth it, though. (And there are great little places to get dessert around the park!)A pocket? A POCKET?! There's no room for a pocket on my filthy loincloth.Best part is you guys are talking like 440 USD for 1 visit is not that badSorry for your loss.  I also call my grandmother "Nana".  I haven't met many of us.  We spent 3 days in Naxos and absolutely loved it. The port is a bit touristy but there are so many cool shops and restaurants just beyond that. Would highly recommend renting a car for the day (~40 euro if I remember correctly) and driving all around the island. There’s so much to see between the mountains, villages, hidden beaches...plus some truly breathtaking viewsI'm an expat living in Greece, I've visited a bunch, I'd second Naxos, but also recommend the Ionian side with Zakynthos and Kefalonia. Zakynthos is super touristy in certain spots (navagio beach omg) but if you can find a small tour boat company to take you off to a nearby smaller beach holy hell, such beautiful white sand and azure water. Kefalonia is all around pretty, again certain spots touristy as hell, the Melissani Cave is incredible and otherworldly, but you do have to expect to queue quite a while to get in (I think it took us about an hour of waiting, but if you google the photos are accurate). If you want completely not touristy I recommend Amorgos in the Cyclades, which is a quiet off-the-beaten track sort of place, quite popular for Greeks to visit for vacation but almost no tourists, for a very authentic, quiet, relaxing break. Ammouliani is my equivalent for that in the north, we had a friend with a boat license and god it was so nice to just rent a small boat for a day with a picnic box full of food and laze on the beach, snorkelling, eating, napping, repeat all day. Something middle of the line between those extremes might be somewhere like Syros. If you go to any of the islands in summer I would actually recommend hiring a quadbike/ATV unless you want to carry your luggage around with you as you explore, they're a lot of fun, cool, easy to drive and great for the -not always fantastic- roads. If you like watersports definitely go for Naxos (kitesurfing, windsurfing in particular).Check out the biggest island Crete. I go every 3 years and spend 5 weeks there to see family and there's so much to do. Great nightlife, shopping, top beaches around the world (elafonisi) beautiful sceneries and very affordable. No. There was a prehistoric (legendarny) warlord Krak who was a chieftan of local Slavs. After his death a big mound has been raised (Kopiec Krakusa) probably around VI-VIII c.

The city got its name after this legendary ruler.I just broke my foot in Shanghai. A Chinese lady took me to a public hospital even though we couldn't even speak the same language, got me sorted. Hospital registration and medical card, doctors visit and xrays all cost me a whopping $14 USD. The foot brace was    almost a hundred, but a third party salesman had to deliver it to the hospital, and my crutches were $23USD. 

When my toddler got stitches in a different city in China, I took him to a private clinic that spoke English and it was $460 for 2 stitches.**Attention! [Serious] Tag Notice**

And not just once, do it on a schedule. Theoretically, every call/email/letter they receive represents 1,000 of their constituents.

The first time SOPA/PIPA went up for a vote, there was a massive grassroots Internet campaign. Reddit, Wikipedia, and many other websites shut down for the day with messages encouraging people to write in. They did and most of the House and Senate reversed their positions. 
[deleted]Web Dev here:

Learn/Use BLOCKCHAIN.

Ethereum Dapps (Distributed applications) are to web applications as torrents are to content. You cannot stop them without shutting down the entire net. Once they take off, they run their course. We need Dapp message boards, marketplaces, services, then nothing can be controlled and everything will be open source/transparent.  

Blockchain DApps are the biggest thing to happen to the internet since the internet was invented.There are a few things that you can do to help, using what you're fighting to protect; *the internet*.

* **Get yourself educated** - Know what you're fighting for.  Basically it's making sure internet service providers (ISPs) can't control what you see or do online in favor of their own interests.  There are plenty of resources online for further details.

* **Contact your representatives** - One of the best ways to make sure your voice heard is to tell your senators and representatives that you support net neutrality.

* **Sign "Save Net Neutrality" petitions**

* **Spread awareness on social media**

* **Support organizations that fight to protect Net Neutrality**Unfortunately, the Net Neutrality decision is being done by an executive branch administration called the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The FCC is not under the control of Congress, rather, the President. 

So what can you, the average Joe, do? **Vote.** Every year.

Congress *can* make Net Neutrality a law, and therefore nullify the FCC's decision-making abilities on Net Neutrality, but under a Republican-controlled Congress and a Republican President, it won't happen.


So we're kinda stuck right now. That's right, **we will lose Net Neutrality by the end of this year.** We can petition and yell and tweet at the FCC but ultimately we made our decision on Net Neutrality back in the 2016 election when we chose the current President and our current representatives in Congress.

But next November, 2018 is a Congressional election. So **vote.** And **vote** in your state/local governments in 2019. And then **vote** in both the Congressional and Presidential elections in 2020.
Write your representative.

With enough outrage eventually they realize the money they are offered isn't worth their position.My senators are bought out and they essentially ignore my letters, calls, etc
What else is there for me to do People need to participate in this thing called Government.  You can't just sit around and vote for President every 4 years.  You have to stay involved or else you get what we have now.  We, the people, get an F for participating in our own future.I know it's very unlikely to happen and someone fill me in on Facebooks stance on Net Neutrality but I think *part* of the problem is that so many people don't know what it is and / or why it matters. 

So I had this idea - taken from last time there was a major vote on this issue:

Have Facebook do the thing that many other sites did - shut down the site and show the spoofy "You don't have the Facebook package" like many sites and part of reddit did. 

If Facebook did something like this the impact and hopefully outrage would be huge. Huge audience and people would learn directly *exactly* what might happen.Go to [gofccyourself.com](http://gofccyourself.com) click the express button and file a complaint directly to the FCC. And thank John Oliver for the hilarious url. Be educated on the topic at minimum. I kid you not my mom seriously thought NN was a liberal propaganda to turn the internet into a “snowflake safe space” and she was so mad that NN was still around and demanded that it be removed. So, uh, stay woke folks. I just called my representative and gave that spiel that was posted in the website (from the comments in the r/news post about this). Felt like an awkward robot speaking a foreign language as talked about "Title II oversight of Internet Service Providers" whatever that is, but hopefully I made a small difference in a conservative stateI don't live in US. What can I do?I just completed the loop through https://www.battleforthenet.com/ and it really couldn't have been much easier. It's extremely easy to get involved and the people were very polite on the other end.Post something along these lines to FB, IG or any other social media platform you use...

>Did you hear Ajit Varadaraj Pai at the FCC is going kill America's Net Neutrality while we are celebrating Thanksgiving? With his new concept, you will subscribe to a package of websites you can visit.  There will be no more "Unlimited" as you know it.  When you access websites outside of your package, you will pay extra for it each month.  As time goes by, the fee to access sites outside of your package will increase to the point where it will no longer be feasible to visit anything outside of your plan. Not even our President can stop Ajit Pai.  Let's show this guy who he is dealing with!  Contact your local representatives NOW!All the people saying, "write to congress! sign a petition!" aren't wrong, but this is like the 43rd time. 

What can we do to save it permanently? I'm out of gas to fight this. They wore us down. They will continue to attack it over and over and over again until they win. 

And ruin the internet. If only a ton of websites would all be willing to black out again for a few hours. Maybe in cyber Monday. Or the day before. That's a pretty big way to show the impact. Although I guess they don't want to hurt their profits, so maybe not that day. Honestly though, with the way things are going and how often this topic is brought up, It needs to be sticky post on r/all.

Although I'm in Europe even *I* think if net neutrality in US is damaged by that idiot, it might cause a snowball effect or at least it will affect the entire Internet somehow somewhere and not in a good way.Fire the companies that try to take advantage of it's death.It's more practical to tell you what *won't* work. Hopefully people will stop wasting their time doing it because it accomplishes absolutely nothing useful or productive: 

- Letter writing campaigns to your local congressman
- Phone calls to your local congressman

Congressmen don't give a rat's ass about you, your problems, concerns, or grievances.  Of course they'll deny it and put on a smile and tell you how important everyone's voice is, but that's just what politicians do.  At the end of the day all they care about is their fat paycheck and pension. Huge powerful telecom corporations will fatten their wallets far more than anything you can do to achieve the opposite.  Phone calls or letter writing campaigns with threats to not re-elect them will fall upon deaf ears because they sincerely don't give a shit about anything you have to say. 

If Net Neutrality is going to be saved, it's not because a bunch of commoners like us whined a lot via email, snail mail, or phone calls.  It's going to be because someone with power to do something about it had the principles to do something about it.Go back in time and vote differently. 

In all seriousness, we KNEW this was at stake in the 2016 election. We KNEW Trump was going to scrap net neutrality and put us all over a barrel for the cable companies. This was a known quantity and nobody can claim ignorance. If you didn't want net neutrality scrapped you shouldn't have fucking voted for Pussy Grabber In Chief. Remember folks, net neutrality is only part of the battle. We still have to deal with the other shitty practices that the major ISPs do because they have government-enforced monopolies. Our next step should be to get rid of the regulations that prevent competition, so we can actually have decent prices, speeds, and better customer service. Hell, if this was the case, we wouldn't even need NN laws.

Don't just make your letter about net neutrality, make it a serious statement showing that you are fed up with the cronyism that dominates the telecommunications industry.I plan on talking to people, contacting reps, and joining protests if they have them (live in DC area so this should be possible).

Also, I have a question that maybe someone knows the answer to. The proponents of ending neutrality keep talking about ISPs being able to "innovate" if neutrality is ended. Does anyone know what "innovations" they think are possible that net neutrality is holding back?

Edit: I appreciate the explanations of what net neutrality is and the bad things that will happen if it ends; I don't want to discourage this spread of information. But that's not answering my question. The folks who want to end net neutrality keep on saying that killing net neutrality will bring "innovation." So my question is what exactly is this "innovation" that they claim killing net neutrality will bring?I wrote in about it and the senators in Utah believe government bad, business good. How should I respond?
Below is an email I received from senator Mike Lee's office:
Thank you for your letter regarding net neutrality. Senator Lee appreciates you taking the time to write in with your thoughts, and he has asked that I ensure you receive a response.
Senator Lee believes the Internet is not broken and is one of the most productive and innovative sectors of our economy. This is because the government has consistently followed a hands-off approach. However, the past FCC tried to expand its authority so that it could regulate the Internet. This was its third attempt to pass so-called “net neutrality” rules and regulations that would result in fewer Internet options, increased costs, and slower access to important services. If particular Internet service providers are engaged in anticompetitive behaviors that harm consumers and competition, our antitrust laws are there to stop that. It may be appropriate for Congress to review how those laws are being enforced in the Internet area. But it is certainly not in the best interest of consumers, for a 5-person unelected Commission to drastically alter the operation, maintenance, and accessibility of the Internet. This could in fact break the Internet. As the ranking member of the Antitrust Subcommittee, Senator Lee is dedicated to promoting a robust, competitive Internet market and will continue to monitor the actions taken by the FCC. I have shared your comments with the Senator, and he will continue to reflect on your words as he works to address this issue.
Senator Lee places a high priority on constituent feedback and would encourage you to remain engaged in dialogue about the important issues facing Utah and our nation. You can do so by continuing to write or call into our office, learning more about his Article 1 Project, subscribing to Senator Lee’s newsletter, following the Senator on social media, and by signing up for his tele-townhalls at this link or by texting “senmikelee” to 828282.
Best regards,

How do I respond to this??nothing.  Net neutrality is going to be wiped away.  The only thing that can be done is to elect a new administration that will implement it again.Vote for people (Democrats typically, but do your homework) who care about Net Neutrality. Volunteer for their campaigns. Donate money, donate time.

Is there anything those of us outside the US can do, it seems like they are making some very big decisions that will have a global impact.I don't think a lot of people know how easy it is to fax your representatives from your phone. Here's some copy pasta for your eye holes. You can fight for, or against, net neutrality from your phone using [this messaging service](https://resistbot.io) (by texting RESIST to 50409) that will find and fax your representatives *for you*; and if you are for net neutrality and don't know what to tell them there is a predrafted letter [here](https://www.battleforthenet.com/letter/) that you can send to them. The messaging is free except for whatever your plan charges for texts. If you can't afford text messaging services, it's also available on Facebook. It took me less than 5 minutes to let my representatives know my thoughts. I'm not a bot or ad, I just want to inform those who don't know how simple this is.

Edited for having copy pasted the wrong text.How about non Americans? I did go to sign the petition but am outside of US borders, and it asked for adresses. What can l do as a European so the problem doesn't spread to other ISP around the world? Boycotts.

It would be hard at first. Sadly, people are actually addicted to the internet.

But Boycotts are historically the single most effective method of delivering the message.

and yes, i am being completely serious here.Apparently nothing because they just vote again every time it doesn't pass. There is seriously another vote every couple months. Anyone who thinks calling their congressman works for anything on any level is living in a fantasy land.Vote for the right people, let the people you vote for know the deal. As an individual you're more or less powerless, but as a collective you have the power, and you've got to act like it a little even if it doesn't feel like you have any power.



That and watch who you give your money to when buying things.Understand how the internet and ISP work so when idiots proclaim "Gov't screws up everything!" You can rebuke them with. 

"That's not how any of this works."Right now, call representatives and make comments to the FCC whenever you get the opportunity. Unfortunately that still probably won't change anything. Once it's gone, the most important thing to do to bring regulations back is to vote for democrats. There is very little overlap between the parties when it comes to Net Neutrality.Purchase a time machine and travel back to Nov 8, 2016.

Pull the lever for Hillary Clinton.

If we were to lose net neutrality which is certainly a possibility here, is it likely to get it back?How about getting as mad about it as people have about the EA pay for play?I've called my senator and I just got the "Yes sir, we'll give him the message" bullshit.  I've never felt so dismissed and unheard in my life.

edit:  then again, he's taken almost $60,000 from telecom companies so far, so...It's not so much what the average *Joe* can do, but rather what the average *Joes* can do.Go here: https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/filings/express

Type **17-108** ("Restoring internet fredom") in the "Proceeding(s)" box.

Fill out your information.

Write in clear and concise words in the Comments box that you are in SUPPORT of Net Neutrality and wish for NN rules to STAY.Can Europeans do anything to help? I'll give you the honest answer: Nothing. Absolutely nothing.Vote in 2016. Oh, wait.Try to spread awareness.  I talked to a few of my (older) family members and showed them the save the internet website. None of them were aware of what happened in 2015 or had any idea what's going on currently.  They all watch and read news daily and none were familiar with net neutrality.  Yeah. What can I do?Stop voting for Republicans.Stop voting Republican.

No snark intended.Vote Democrat.https://www.battleforthenet.com/ you can contact your rep's here!Vote Democratic.  Support the Democratic party.  Do not elect GOP members.  VERY VERY serious here.Stop voting for republicansWhere's the copy paste of all the links with resources of who to contact for your address?I get updates about town hall meetings via text message. I have been to a few and they always urge me to ask about net neutrality.Learn about net neutrality.  Understand what it means.  And then talk about it to everyone that you know.  Be accurate when doing so.

And don't make it into a partisan issue.  Allow room on the net neutrality boat for Republican supporters if they would like to join.  Turning it into a partisan issue is how we got to where we are today.  It needs to be clear that net neutrality is something all people want, regardless of party affiliation; and that there is nothing about ending net neutrality that appeals to either party's core principles.Contact companies. Google, Netflix, etc. Tell them that as a consumer, you expect them to fight this.

Sadly, money talks and Congress is already bought and paid for. These types of businesses still have a monetary incentive to please their customers (and in some cases the destruction of net neutrality will cost them). We need the corporations to fight for us. It's fucked, but it's the only way, since our representatives fight for an industry and not the people.Don't forget, not only is net neutrality being taken away, they are also making it so it can't be over turned by future administrations.Realistically, nothing without breaking the law. Writing congress, calling, etc has not worked because the news is not covering it any moore. Nothing really.

Everyone will down vote me for being cynical, but at the end of the day, the data clearly shows that laws are passed despite what the people want, and more in line with what corporations want.

Take a big, fat, chunky, peanut filled shit right into Ajit's Reese's mug. That prick. 

Serious comment. Vote out the Republicans forever.Realistically? Nothing. The FCC (ajit pai) already asked the publics opinion so he could ignore it. You've voted for senators etc, if they don't support net neutrality then you're shit out of luck I'm afraid because THEY'RE the ones who get the say on legislation. It doesn't matter how many people phone a number, email an address, write a letter, talk about etc, the FCC and the government will do what they want.Stop voting for Republicans.This may ruffle some feathers, but it needs to be said. Compare the number of republicans who are going for destruction of net neutrality verses the number of democrats. You'll see quite the divide. At this stage republicans have shown their true colors in many ways. If you support net neutrality and ever vote republican again you don't actually support net neutrality. If you ever choose not to vote you don't actually support net neutrality. I think if the average Joe could come up with a way to get all those people that crushed EA and forced them to remove microtranactions to care about net neutrality that would work. Those same people should care since the net effects gaming so not sure why they could get an EA post to over half a million down votes but the net neutrality can't get anymore than 100k is beyond me. So yeah if somehow you could get that group to care it would be great. 

This is a legit response. That group showed how powerful a voice can be if loud enough Now protest. In the future, vote Republicans out of office./u/NetNeutralityBot has some suggestions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/7d6ujp/z/dpvgg3c)Nothing in the short term. Long term... Vote  wisely next year during congressional mid-terms.Lobby your City Council to create a municipal ISP that will draft plans to install and roll out gigabit or faster service to every home.

Encourage your city to take the Next Century Cities pledge and [become a Next Century City](http://nextcenturycities.org/members/) (which should more rightly be called a "this century city").

Raise funds to bring [Susan Crawford](http://scrawford.net/) to come speak to your City Council if you're in a big city, or [read her books](http://scrawford.net/books) to understand the history of how we came to be robbed by Big Telco (*Captive Audience*) and what it is currently costing us (*Responsive City*).

You will learn that our cities–even small, relatively rural ones–have already paid many times over through taxes for the big telecom incumbent in your area to wire our homes with fiber. They have taken our money and dragged their feet on installing new technology. They provide fast Internet to businesses because businesses demand it and are willing to pay their high prices, passing the costs on to us as customers. The people that are supposed to be representing our interests in government have undergone an almost complete regulatory capture by the Big Telcos, so they have let them get away with murder.

Comcast, AT&T, and Time Warner have simply been pocketing billions of dollars given to them by the federal and state governments on the promise that they'll modernize infrastructure, but then they never do. This is a clear example of trickle-down economics in action–they promise to invest in their business and expand access for all, they get the money, and then they use a small bit of it to lobby Congress to let them slide on the delivery.

If you think this only applies to big cities, you're wrong. There are many, many small cities across the country that have already opted out of this nonsense and built their own networks.

* [Sandy, Oregon residents pay $60/month](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBztjr2uCzg) for gigabit fiber to the home service
* [Chelan County, Washington](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ0EovEe0DA) has had gigabit speeds since 2006
* [Longmont, Colorado](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiSaMQcogG4) has their own residential fiber network

In all of these cases **these are profitable operations**. At the rates we currently pay to Comcast and other nightmare companies with terrible customer service, these places have been able to invest in their own municipally owned infrastructure and pay for it and use the proceeds to reduce local fees and taxes–they are **making money** off this business.

We are getting screwed for decades. This has been our situation since cable TV and it's getting worse instead of better with the Internet.Yeah, I live in nyc and my senators will not agree to this. I guess what we can do is spread the word to other people. Also donate to the eff to help them. Also if you use amazon smile or humble bundle you can make the eff your donation. [removed]May I present the John F. Kennedy quote that will get me sent to the reeducation camp in the 2020's:

[Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/89101-those-who-make-peaceful-revolution-impossible-will-make-violent-revolution)Would it be a crime to email the representatives of another location who supports it, and lie about being in their district? Send a letter to them saying you won't vote for them next time and that you disagree with their position on net neutrality. Let's get a gofundme account started and "donate" what we get to our senators. It seems to be the only way. If we can't congregate our voices so they care, if we congregate our money, they will.
Spread the word. Talk about it with your friends and share news about it on social media.I live in Eastern Washington, and my representative is Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who not only takes huge donations from Comcast and other ISP’s, but is openly misleading people via email, social media, etc. about her stance on NN. She’s basically spinning it like we’re updating “antiquated” rules. 


Anyway, point I’m getting at: She has too much money for her to care about what her constituents think, and until someone can threaten her *12 year* incumbency, she’ll do whatever she wants. I feel completely powerless as a constituent about most issues. There's also value in writing/calling Representatives to thank them for their support. Pressure goes both ways, you need to award good behavior as well as punish bad.

Edit: Someone asked me to add this; if you are socially anxious and afraid of phones like me, https://resistbot.io/ will text your senators and representatives for you.Pretty much. Write letters, and call his office. Fuck Ajit Pai, though. One of the world's assholes right now. Write to them stating your support that they are representing their constituents. Let them know the effort is worth it. I've said this before but I believe that this will help garner Republican support.

Make a meme with a picture of Hillary Clinton and the text, "The Dems want to do for the internet what they did for health care." Then state how they can stop Pei from the FCC and spread that around until enough right-wing voters make an uproar about this.

I am 100% serious about this but I can't make a meme and I'm not on an social media (other than Reddit, I suppose). But if someone can get this started, his could be the thing to help!!Phone calls are most effective. I don’t wanna sound like an ass... but when I do call, what the hell do I say? do I just go in point blank or what

Edit: thank you all for helping here. Let’s get in this and get these net neutralities togetherMake ten men feel like a hundredWhat is net neutrality? Should I be for or against it?Do be aware that some people are just going to be angry if you mention that Republicans are the party supporting this. I told my cousin about it and he just sent my snowflake emojis until I just quit talking to him about it. He was absolutely against the end of NN until I mentioned Republicans supported it. I told him I won't be buying online games soon because I'm worried about this and even after I sent a link to the FCC website talking about how they plan to destroy NN he just kept calling it fake news.The funny thing is, I've shown friends and family members everything about net neutraility and how it can fuck us all. I've literally been laughed at, and or they will say *THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN, THEY'LL NEVER DO THAT TO THE INTERNET STOP WORRYING* the average joe even if told about it simple seems to not give a fuck, or think its crazy talk. Im an English teacher in Portugal, and I tried using it as a discussion topic for an advanced level class. we read an article and I tried to not be a crazy alarmist when I highlighted that our country is one of the biggest offenders.

The response was a resounding "meh, what's the harm?" :[  Some people only look at the price tag and not the cost.I explained it to a co-worker as this. "Imagine the internet is all the roads in the country. Now imagine if every time you wanted to go to say, the Movies, you had to pay $5 just to be allowed to drive there. Want to go to the Krogers? That'll be $8.99. What if your favorite restaurant is considered competition by the roadway owners? Well guess you're never going there ever again. That's what the internet will be like with websites without Net Neutrality." That opened his eyes real quick. This. I talked to comcast employees over the phone while they were assisting me, and NONE of them knew about it and they were super happy to learn about it.We need another SOPA/PIPA movement for this net neutrality.

We need websites to shut down again so users everywhers can get the message that we are in trouble. News networks will mever present this information because they owned by the same people who want this essentially.My congressman already stated he's not running again, so it's likely my voice won't have any sway with him. Pat Tiberi can go fuck himself. Rob Portman, on the other hand, will get some words.This is actually not a very good idea if the issue is imminent. Old-fashioned mail does not travel directly to the offices of Congress. Instead, it is routed through a security facility where it is scanned and analyzed, first. This was done after the 2001 anthrax attacks. You can expect your letter to arrive approximately 3 weeks after you mail it.How come websites aren't doing this again? I imagine this can't be good for some giant internet corporations.I wrote my congresswoman. She wrote back and said "Net neutrality is a stifling regulation on businesses". Yes, net neutrality is stifling. My congresswoman is horrifying.I worked on a gubernatorial campaign back in undergrad. As is typical in my state, the campaign was blended with several others, including one for US Senate and few for US HoR. 

I noticed two things: 1) local candidates pay a lot more attention to physical mail than their national counterparts and 2) national candidates/politicians living in D.C. frequently have zero fucking clue what their constituents care about. The frequency and potency of contact just isn't there. Also their races are crazy expensive so they have to pander to those corporation$$$. So they'd ask the other, more local candidates what people were actually concerned about. Weird right? 

My point: write everyone. Write your Senators and your Reps, but also your state-level candidates and senators and reps. Tell others to do the same. Eventually it will filter up. A state party telling a national Senator "hey, people are actually pretty riled up about this" can work just as well if not better than letters directly to the Senator.

edit to clarify: definitely still write the national candidates. write everyone. 

I did this and Tim Scott told me basically to go fuck myself> Write to your Senator and Congressman. Seriously. A real letter, written, signed, stamped, and delivered by the USPS. If enough constituents write in, they realize that no matter how much Verizon is donating to their campaign, they're not getting re-elected if their district really hates them.

I used to live in DC and know enough people in politics; this won't really do anything. The members of Congress who are needed to fight for net neutrality have a greater financial responsibility to their corporate donors that want net neutrality to end than they have to their constituents.

The only way to stop this needs to be a coordinated effort by websites, servers and providers of near-essential Internet services to essentially shut down and enrage everyone into action.I've been faxing them via text bot. It's been pretty effective.https://www.mailmygov.com/ will help you find your senators and congressmen, and send them a letter. You should can also find your FCC reps (and all the way down to city council!) too.

(Yes, I'm the owner, MailMyGov was founded on exactly the idea that a real letter is more effective. Any feedback is appreciated!)What if I already know my congresswoman is voting in opposition? Postcards are faster. Letter have to go through extra security checks. What about someone from outside the US? Anything we can do to help?I advise every american with the ability to do this.
The proposition might be in your government, but it affects us all. 

I'm sad I can't contribute because this might signify the end for a lot of smaller websites/startups. 
Use your democratic abilities!Shut down everytging for an hourPhone calls are more effective. I doubt writing to anyone will help. A Congressman's mindset is this: On one hand I have a large company that put a quarter million dollars into my reelection fund. On the other hand, broke ass Joe spent 49 cents for a stamp. Hmmmm, what a decision. Quarter million dollars, or broke ass Joe. What to do...what to do? I do like a quarter million dollars, but then broke ass Joe did walk all the way to his mailbox. What does broke ass Joe even want? Oh, some internet thing-a-ma-jig. Well, I guess Comcast would know more about the Internet than some guy who sends postal mail rather than an email, like it is the year nineteen eighty something.I would add getting a confirmation on that letter is also worth it. 
To add to this, there are even services in which you can type it all on your phone via a bot, and the bot faxes it to their office with a nice heading and all. what if your not american?I work in a congesssional office so my recommendation is to CALL not write. Letters get filed away and looked at kind of but not really but with a call we immediately log your concern so I recommend a call to your local congressional office.This. My writing fingers are ready! If it does pass I imagine it won't be long until our lot do the same thing.Yeah, I too would like to know how to help. We are in this shit together, at the very least in the long term.I'm in Mexico, so I fear if this happens in the US they will try to do the same here, and once they start trying, well, it's gonna go through at the very first try.. You know how it affects the US and certain companies will have to pay extra for their services to properly? It ends up at the consumer, but we in Europe are consumers too. No reason to not increase cost globally in that case. 

More importantly, it's going to kill some companies since they'll need to demand more money from consumers, which isn't always going to happen obviously. They'll go under and we Europeans will then not be able to make use of their services anymore either. 

Really, people call it a slippery slope, but basically this whole deal is just a provider getting the power to ask for more money for nothing. And that money comes from somewhere. Either a business goes under or we consumers pay more. Either directly to the provider or indirectly to whoever provides the service. I'm a really techy guy, but not well versed in developing/programming. I understand the best basics of blockchain, but still trying to fully understand it. Could you give me an, "explainitlikeim5" breakdown? Or perhaps point to some resources that would help?And vote democrat.

Edit: Lots of salt to this comment, but voting records don't lie.This is such an important comment. Turning Net Neutrality, aka Title II, into a law will be our next step if/when the FCC decides to revoke it this December. Do your research and contact your representatives about their feelings on NN and vote accordingly to ensure we have people in Congress who will vote to turn Title II (or a variation of it) into law. 

Don’t let them wear us down as apathy will be the death of NN. We may lose this one battle with the FCC but we still have options. This is unfortunately the right answer. 

Calling your congressman or senator, or writing them a letter, is good practice for legislation down the road, but Net Neutrality is dead.

So dead.This is the real answer right here!This is the real hard truth right here. Decision was made last November. There's a lot of things I would think have opened people's eyes on how important our elections are, but I certainly hope this is one of them. Even though much of our mainstream news may not make it seem this way, these elections are about a long list of issues, not about personalities and lesser of two evils and warm fuzzy feelings when you cast your vote. You're not going to agree with a candidate on everything, you shouldn't. But make damn sure you agree with them on things like Net Neutrality. Some of the issues the parties push aren't actually all that important and aren't actually all that actionable. The American public really needs to get more informed and stop treating our government like a popularity contest or spectator sport. Because this is what happens, we get distracted by scandal and we get taken advantage of.Fuck. We are so fucked.NN for now is done. The GOP have made it clear that they do not support it. 

The only way to actually get it back is to vote for democrats in 2018. If the House flips and Democrats gain a majority in the senate they can pass legislation guaranteeing NN.

That's the only way this changes. I knew the second Trump was elected that it was done, and everyone here should have seen it coming.I wrote my representatives. They all replied with the same cookie cutter bullshit. Everyone keeps saying this but my rep. is already in favor of keeping Net Neutrality so do I really need to do anything?Yes, you can do this but don't expect much.  

I wrote my representative on FL, Gus Bilrakis, and he sent back an auto reply saying it's important to the industry that they don't have regulations so they can innovate. The response said if not for all the regulations our technology would be more advanced. I shit you not. 

The reps not in favor of net neutrality don't give a shit how many emails they get asking them to change. They care about how full their campaigns bank accounts are.Don't vote for them in the next election Sit outside their office window with signs that say "You're fired."Voting for the other president actually is the most effective way this could have been stopped. >  You can't just sit around and vote for President every 4 years  
  
If you would have done that at least it would have helped.  It was a core part of the Republican platform and the president picks the head of the FCC.  >  part of the problem is that so many people don't know what it is and / or why it matters.

This is a huge problem. I was expliaining net neutrality to one of my coworkers who I actually respect a great deal (even though we disagree on a lot) and his response was "Huh, if this was real then I think I would have heard about it on the news".  /sighFacebook are very anti net neutrality.

They have a whole sub company that is designed to break net neutrality in the 3rd world.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Basicshow do you properly navigate this site, I'm calling my senators tomorrow but I would still like to file my thoughts on Net NeutralityThe very first thing you should do is make sure you know what the issue is about, especially if you don't know what Title 2 is and how it relates to the Net Neutrality debate. 

There isn't a law saying that there should be net neutrality. There isn't one side supporting an open internet and another side full of evil scrooges with no argument other than a desire to hurt the common people. I mean, other than the big ISPs, which fit that description.

I side with the group supporting regulation that ensures net neutrality, but it hurts the legitimacy of the argument when there's a large number of people that don't even know what the argument means.

In short: "net neutrality" as it exists today essentially categorizes ISPs in "Title 2" public utility, similar to many other public utilities. 

The other side argues that the regulation puts unnecessary restriction on ISPs which hurts growth, or possible that classifying ISPS under Title 2 isn't the best way to ensure net neutrality. And so on.

Make people aware on social mediaSpread awareness, either to other unaware U.S. citizens, or people outside of the U.S.. Specifically target that the U.S. is simply a stepping stone, and if Net Neutrality dies here, it'll roll over outside of the U.S..We need to remove the congress people who support it. Donate to and vote for their opponents.  At this stage, votes and money to buy votes are what counts. Vote for Democrats to run the country in 2018 and 2020?  Seems like this box was closed last time one was in office.Get it passed as a law on a state level, use some of that states rights that republicans jack off to.

...... I have no idea where to start with that though Let’s get physical 

— Olivia Newton John I, as a regular person, can't fire some the most powerful companies in the worldMore like set fire to the companies that support it100% this. FCC commissioners are appointed, not elected. Also, people in Congress have had around a 90% reelection rate for decades. They know that no matter what they do, they will most likely be reelected, so they really don't care what you think.The only "innovation" they'll roll out is tiered service and slow access to sites you haven't paid for priority access to. It's going to be a complete negative for the consumer.Basically it means they can throttle or un-throttle traffic. (Hint your traffic as it stands now has no throttle on the speed. Only on the volume.)

We often speak of speed of internet traffic as such, but it really is "theoretical volume of data over X amount of time" not actual speed. (There are in fact a multitude of ways to impact both.)

Think of it more like how cell phones work, After X limit of data they cut your speeds. (Volume)

**Theoretically** they could adjust your routing and traffic paths to various sites. HOWEVER. Your traffic doesn't just go over your ISP's network. It goes over lots of networks... (Whom they have shared peer agreements with to not charge one another for their traffic.) And if one path gets congested it's built into the protocol to find the next quickest path.

It is also possible to allocate networks to just accept traffic from one address to another. AKA you to netflix's domain. HOWEVER this is not a flexible plan and you'd need more redundancy built into it. (AKA money) Also once again if they don't control all of the routing points from address to address it's not really a direct link.Well he's conservative isn't he? Most conservatives believe in small government interference and more individual freedoms and consequences. The internet is working now so by their nature they wouldn't try to expand government into something that doesn't need it. You have to somehow prove that you need to do something. Which may prove difficult given it sounds like he's spent some time evaluating the issue.Thank you. Also read above if you haven't already, a few times this question was asked.You're protected under the EU.It's disgusting. 

*We* give Comcast the money they use to bribe our representatives (whom we also pay) with the net result of us getting fucked.

The ONLY thing that would get through to them is if there was a mass cancellation of service. Absolutely! The next step is to bypass the FCC and urge Congress to turn Title II into law. This could actually lead to stronger rules and enforcement and put us better off than we were. 

The bad news is that we may still lose Net Neutrality for a while until we can fix it. The good news is that primaries are next year, so we have an opportunity to research the candidates, learn who favors Net Neutrality, and fucking vote for them.  And do what? You can't refund anything back at them. 100% this.  And along those lines, if you care about net neutrality, and you think that literally “both sides are the same,” then vote for the side that’s in favor of net neutrality FFS.  How hard is that to understand or do?Hey if the power of Reddit can crush EA and force McDonalds to bring back a relic, I don’t see why we can’t save net neutrality...Wilson NC, gigabit up and downstream, city owned, TWC don't like it but it's still thereAnd chances are, the reason you have only one or two providers is because city hall traded a monopoly for free infrastructure/high fees/direct kickbacks or some combination.

Tell them you want a real choice in ISP.  You don't necessarily need your city to build it, but they damn sure need to let more than one ISP do it.> Lobby your City Council to create a municipal ISP that will draft plans to install and roll out gigabit or faster service to every home.

As someone who is not opposed to reversing ISPs as common carriers - I like this idea a lot. Take the power into your own hands if the ISPs are such thugs. You don't use the police to work with criminals, so why work with the ISPs you believe to be criminals.I love how every single piece of advice currently is basically begging corrupt rich representatives to be decent human beings.

This is a fantastic post, well said. But it also reminds me of the episode of Portlandia where Fred starts his own cell phone company for his 9 friends.[removed]Well written out, thank you! What kind of investment would be required to get gigabit internet infrastructure built for a town of let's say 200k?Make it clear to them that you would be happy to vote for (opposite party than them) if they would vote for net neutrality. If enough people say this, it wont matter how much money they are being offered if a sizable portion of their constituents will vote them out. Why does amazon's website suck so hard? I can't find a way to change my smile to this. I searched EFF and Net Neutrality. Anybody know how to do this?Wait what are you talking about? I’m pretty sure Gillibrand and Schumer are both in favor of Net NeutralityUm, both Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand are in favor of net neutrality? I don't think there are any Democratic senators that oppose it.I know I'm late, but as a heads up to anyone coming here from the front page, Smile donates quarterly and all participating non-profits should have just received their ACH payment through September 30. The nonprofit won't get Amazon smile money until January 15th for the October to December period. Humble Bundle goes through PayPal and the donations are a monthly lump sum.

I wanted to email props to Congressman Jeffries the other day after seeing him shut Sessions down but one of the first things the website asks for is for your zip code.

Edit: Not that you couldn't look that info up but I wish you were allowed to correspond with other districts' congresspeople.I doubt it's illegal. Probably a crime to vote in their jurisdiction though... I don't know. I dunno. Doesn't jive with my morals, though.You may as well say that you live in another state. It's not like it'd do any *harm*. Either they ignore it, or put your opinion into consideration anyway.You can do it, but there's no point to it. If you lie about being in state then the senator has a great reason to ignore you. 

People would do this to Paul Ryan all the time. I can't find the articles, but there was a good one in Atlantic a few months ago about why this is useless - it gives him an excuse to say most of his constituents are OK with it and the people whining are from out of state. That's why letters and calls are more impactful than emailBut they are opposed to it.

Edit: they fixed their comment nowwhat i'm wondering is; if they'll just go through with it regardless. Basically a Hail Mary; push this through as fast as possible to reap the benefits until it gets changed back from a new administration. I *would* say that threats and promises to not vote for them in the future; might not be enough for them to care about *if* they see a larger benefit to passing it. That guy is a textbook sociopath.Write Ajit Pai a letter full of glitter that gets everywhereI was once told that the order of mental importance is phone, snail mail, fax, and then email. The order of most annoying/ disruptive to someone's schedule to the leastmy roommate works for senator Jerry Moran of Kansas, he takes dozens of calls a day form pissed off people wanting net neutrality (and people wanting to lynch Hillary) he just says "thank you for your concern and we take what our constituents seriously" hangs up the phone, and thats it. the senator never asks who called, they have no system in place to log numbers, NOTHING. no one gives a fuck about your call. Money talks. Yeah probably. But it's easier to send faxes/emails or even letters to a lot of congressmans. If you call, use a different phone number and voice/accent every time so they don’t know it’s the same person.https://www.battleforthenet.com it has a script as well, thank you!Uh, yes... uh... I would like one Net Neutrality, please.  Okay... uh, bye.Google "net neutrality phone call template" and there's a bunch of results. Please don't hurt me, there's so many different flavors I do not know which one to select for you. 

Most of them start "Hello, my name is X. I am calling from my zip code X. Net Neutrality is important to me because X (small business owner concerned about fair competition, concerned about monopoly and/or free speech, believe that a free and open internet is is society's best interest). How can I expect (your politician) to vote on this issue? I strongly support net neutrality and thank you for your time. 

Again, there are tons of templates out there and this is just a quick sample. You can find one that specifically suits your needs, easy![5calls is website that will find your representatives, and give you scripts on what to say for each issue!](https://5calls.org)

depending on the issue they'll even provide a different script based on what party your representative belongs toI called my senators today and took about an hour before hand to write a very lengthy script to "filibuster" them, so to speak, partially as an act of civil disobedience, however both people I spoke with actually were interested to hear all the details and said they learned a couple new things.

[It's important to note that I didn't read this verbatim](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ipo4RlF8WPzbiC0uqTN9tNhLLxfMcYuFBKyNRPascKA/edit?usp=sharing), but just used it as a guideline to keep my thoughts collected as I spoke.I typed one up for you and stole part of one from another...since most supporters are GOP I feel this will resonate with them!


————————

“  Hey! Hope you are doing well. I’m disheartened about [Politicians]’s stance on Net Neutrality. I feel that the protections that are in place will be weakened if we change the way they’re enforced. I would be willing to support a new regulation style if it can guarantee the same or better protections, but not if we lose any.

Let me ask you this...how would you feel if ISPs throttled access to all conservative websites? Once these protections are removed, left leaning networks like CNN or even NBC, which is owned by Comcast, could influence and undermine all efforts by the GOP in upcoming elections...including [Politician]’s. Thanks for allowing me to voice my concerns over this important issue. I hope [Politician] will reconsider his position. Have a great day.  “Internet service providers have to treat all data equally. 

For example look at Comcast. Comcast provides Internet, and Comcast owns hulu. Comcast has the capability to block us from using Netflix (in our own fucking homes) but they can’t because of net neutrality. These laws are going to be voted on again (if it loses we’re fucked). For. Easiest way to explain it is, without NN, ISPs will gain the ability to throttle connections and charge based on data usage, websites you access, etc. It's very bad for us. Great for them.Net neutrality, in my opinion, is a bit of a misnomer. I think the name confuses people on what it actually is. Net neutrality is the act of keeping the internet neutral. Some people use the term data equality which is better I think. Basically, if we didn't have net neutrality, ISPs would be able to control and throttle data based on what that data is. So say they see that Netflix users are a large portion of their data consumption. They can throttle, or slow down internet speeds towards Netflix to the point where it becomes unusable and hold Netflix for ransom. The ISPs can then go to Netflix and say, "Hey Netlflix, people won't be able to use you unless you give us a buttload of cash." At that point Netflix would HAVE to pay them a large sum because they are dependent on usable data speeds. Now, in theory, with a capitalist society, net neutrality shouldn't be a huge issue. If there were a variety of internet service providers, ISPs, you could say, okay well ISP A is throttling my internet I'll just go to ISP B. The problem is that internet is a huge monopoly, especially by Comcast, because it's really difficult to lay down wires connecting to every home. Without neutrality, in addition to internet monopolies, our data usage will not be chosen by us, but rather be chosen for us. When talking to a friend of mine, we got into a heated debate on WHY no net neutrality would be bad. He thinks that control over data from ISP's would make it so the ISP can charge the consumer for access to websites. I don't know if that's a possibility or not, if it is, I don't really think that's likely to happen. They'll go to the big companies that require data and hold them for ransom. If the companies don't comply, the average user won't know what happened. Instead they'll just think, "Oh Netflix is just really slow now, but Hulu is really fast. It's not my internet, it's just Netflix." The lobbying against net neutrality is just a move for big companies to get bigger. It does not benefit citizens at all whatsoever. Net neutrality is an important issue and something that everybody should be for.Internet Service Providers (ISPs) sell you internet. Net neutrality gives them a switch they can turn on or off for you (You pay them - they turn it on - give you internet) 

Without net neutrality, they can cut the internet they sell to you into pieces, they can sell you certain websites in a package - like Cable TV. They can restrict what you see depending on how much you pay (Or what they want you to see)

It turns their switch into hundreds of switches so they can charge individually for every single website if they wanted to. I’m assuming you have internet in your home. Meaning you pay a certain amount of money a corporation every month for access to the internet. All of the internet, whenever you want it, however much you download or upload, at varying speeds (minus sites blocked by your government if your government does that). 

What the FCC is doing is allowing these telecommunication corporations to monopolize the internet, and also charge you (insane rates) for how much bandwidth you use, how much you download, and charge you *extra* to access certain websites/apps. You want to keep using Reddit? 15 bucks a month. Youtube? Another 10. You want to use a VPN? Good fucking luck. It’s like your favorite video games going from purely free-to-play, to a monthly subscription, with extra monthly payments for DLC. 

Telecom wants to triple-dip into your wallet for every last cent. Great question!  Here are a couple of youtube videos that explain it.  It's a lot of the same information in each one:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpbOEoRrHyUNet neutrality is the principle that ISPs cannot control what you see or view on the internet. It also prevents them from prioritizing certain sites. From an economic standpoint, NN allows for startups and small businesses to compete in the online market against larger corporations. If NN was stricken, small business would suffer as they cannot pay for prioritization like larger corporations. I wrote a semi-formal paper on it for my lecture not too long ago that presents both sides in a neutral light, then approaches the pros and cons of each side and the actions each side has taken in the last decade if you would like to read it for more information."Net Neutrality" or Network Neutrality is a set of democratic, egalitarian guiding ***Principles***, created and refined organically over the last 30+ years ***by "Netizens"*** (I.E; you, me and **anyone and everyone** actively participating in the Internet community).

These ***principles*** encompass not only the three ISP-centric "Bright-Line Rules" given teeth in law by the FCC's "Open Internet Order" but many, many others.

Traditionally, the most forthright Net Neutrality Principles have been along the lines of:

* **Thou shalt not block or limit Access Devices —**  A network operator (ISP) may not block or limit what device an end-user may choose to use to connect to the Internet via the ISP's network (like a brand or type of modem, router, etc). Even if the end-user cooks up their own device from scratch in their dorm room or garage (Ex; You, Me, Steve Wozniak), as long as it follows relevant Industry Standards and Protocols and it does not harm the network, the ISP shall not interfere. So, if you think you have the chops to build a better, more capable DOCSIS 3.1/DSL/ISDN/Satellite transceiver device, well, by all means, GO FOR IT!
* **Thou shalt not block or limit Networked devices —** A network operator (ISP) may not block or limit what devices an end-user may choose to connect to the Internet *via their Access Device*. This means they cannot limit or block your use of Computers, TVs, Gaming systems (XBox, Playstation, etc), "Internet of Things" devices like cameras, a fridge or coffee pot, iVibrator, VR-Group-Sexerator or anything else imagined or as yet *unimagined.*
* **Thou shalt route "Best Effort" —** An ISP or network operator should route traffic on a "Best Effort" basis without prejudice or undue favoritism towards certain types of traffic (***especially for a consideration or renumeration from others***). This does not exclude Industry Standard network management and Quality of Service  practices and procedures. It means **DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE, COMCAST**. Get ALL the data where it needs to go as quickly and efficiently as possible.
* **Thou shalt not block or limit Protocols** — An ISP may NOT tell you that you cannot run BitTorrent; or mine BitCoin; or run a WWW server; or a (v)Blog; or a music streaming server so that you can access your Polka collection from anywhere in the world; or run your own customized email server; or a gaming server; or host your security cameras/BabyCam so that grandma in Cincinnati can peek in on her little darling anytime, anywhere; or maybe host **The Next Big Thing™** you dreamed up while masturbating in the shower.
* **Thou shalt not block or limit Services** — An ISP may NOT limit what services you may host or access on your Internet connection. Like Twitter or Facebook, when your government has gone to shit. Or Netflix, because your ISP has arbitrarily decided it has become "too popular" and they want to get their money-grubbing hands in on the action. Or stop you from becoming a Tor node, etc, etc.
* **Thou shalt not Snoop on data** — An ISP may NOT snoop on data streams or packet payloads (I.E; Deep Packet Inspection) for reasons other than Industry Standard Network Management routines and procedures. No snooping on what an end-user does with their Internet connection. No building up of databases of browsing history or "Consumer Habits" for data mining for advertising or other purposes. ISP's are a critical trusted partner in the Internet ecosystem and should strive for network-level data anonymity. An ISP should never undermine whatever level of anonymity an end-user strives to create for themselves.
* **Thou shalt not Molest data** — An ISP may NOT intercept and modify data in-transit except for Industry Standard Network Management routines and procedures.

\# | Example
---|---
1 | Snooping on an end-user's data streams and replacing ads on web pages mid-stream with the ISP's/affiliates own advertising is expressly VERBOTEN. ***(Fuck You,  [CMA Communications and r66t.com](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/04/how-a-banner-ad-for-hs-ok/))***
2 | Snooping on an end-user's data streams so-as to [interject Pop-up ads](http://www.perftech.com/#home) to be rendered by the end-users browser is expressly VERBOTEN. ***(Fuck You, Comcast and your "Data Cap" [warning messages](http://i.imgur.com/35HG6U5.jpg))***
3 | Future Ex; An ISP snooping on 20,000,000 subscriber's data streams to see who "e-Votes" on some initiative (like, say, Net Neutrality! or POTUS) so the ISP can change the vote in the ISP's favor should be expressly VERBOTEN ***now***, not later.

The FCC's existing Bright-line Rules address a number of these principles,

* No Blocking: broadband providers may not block access to legal content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices.
* No Throttling: broadband providers may not impair or degrade lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices.
* No Paid Prioritization: broadband providers may not favor some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration – in other words, no “fast lanes.”  This rule also bans ISPs from prioritizing content and services of their affiliates.

Those are the main ISP-centric Net Neutrality Principles. There are many more. For example, there are guidelines for ***Service*** providers, like Netflix, Google, Reddit, you-name-it. Such as,

Thou shalt not block or limit speech  
Thou shalt not block or limit based upon race, religion, creed, etc, etc.  
I take it he's not a very serious political thinker then? Just because he supports the party's other positions doesn't mean by default he has to support all of their policies, especially one of their worst like being against net neutrality.It’s funny because when something bad does happen the average joe will only have them self to blame and suffer, but unfortunately people who still did care go down as well with them.I love this idea. How we get this started??And we need as much enthusiasm as we have for the EA controversy. A good 700000 downvotes and a lot of chatter will probably get good results.[deleted]Instead of mass writing our senators/congressmen, what about mass writing to Facebook, Google, Netflix, Twitter, Wikipedia?

We need a collective effort - if I write my senator and you write your senator, each senator gets 1 message. If, instead, we each write to the CEO of Google, he gets 2 messages. Multiply this times 350,000 and our effect is much greater when focused on a few, but highly influential, targets than if we piecemeal our power.

Also, I think Netflix should be the main focus. It's one thing to shut down Wikipedia for a day.  Imagine if Netflix went down on a Sunday and, instead, would play only a brief video explaining, in layman's terms, what net neutrality is, it's effect, that it's motivated solely by greed and, if net neutrality is gutted, your Netflix experience will change, your right to an open internet will disappear and, with it, a piece of your freedom as an American.

I'm not tech-savvy. I know that a ddos attack shuts down a website (that's the beginning and end of everything I know about ddos).
I don't know how to make the video I described (I can't even figure out Photoshop), I can't explain net neutrality and, after two years of massive frustration, I still can't get my own website to work.  I don't know a lot about how the internet works but I know net neutrality is absolutely critical.  

If I feel like my rights are being taken away, how are you guys not feeling like Verizon is about take away your entire livelihood? A war is a series of battles.  It's taken a lot but we've won every one of those battles so far; if we give up now, we automatically lose the war.

I can't do anything tech related so I'm using my voice and my ideas.  Not only do you guys know how to do all of the things I've mentioned, Redditors are the most brilliant tech people on the planet.  

It's FCC v Reddit and, with or without you guys, there's no way in hell I'm going down without a fight!

Edit: spellingRob Portman doesn't care. Source: been giving him words for the last 6 months.From your lips to my brain, good sir or madam.Letters can be easily disregarded, too. Constant phone calls, on the other hand, can't be ignored so they're a **lot** more effective.Honestly we need to have major sites locked down and requiring donations to access content.

>This website is testing the effects of eliminating net neutrality. If you would like to proceed please make a donation to help preserve net neutrality. Your donation will allow you access to locked websites and simulates an experience with tiered internet.

You should ask her how. These old republicans who don't understand the internet are the ones making that argument. Explain that net neutrality protects websites, many of which are businesses that help the economy. Them voting it out is what will actually hurt businesses.That's basically what all three of my various congresspeople said.Who is your congresswoman?This is the exact party line my Republican congresspeople use. Talked to (edit - one of) mine (edit: at a charity event) face to face explaining how it actually benefits small businesses like mine by not making me pay a fee to the ISP to get faster service. He said basically that is the direction the internet is heading anyway and it will eventually be good for businesses like mine because of less regulation. Then he stopped talking to me as I tried to tell him my business isn't regulated at all by the FCC, it is the big ISPs that are regulated. I pay the ISPs for my web services and host and provider services from third parties that are not regulated by the FCC at all. The ISPs want to charge me a fee on top of the fee I pay for internet for a fast lane and can throttle my service to non-existence if they want without paying that fee. God politicians are ignorant idiots sometimes. My senator said the exact same thing. I wonder if they each wrote their own fuck off form letter or if Ajit Pai put out a generic one for everyone. Got the same line from mine. The lobbyists have their message down this time, and have delivered it to congress on the backs of lots of benjamins.The idea of applying the information to local as well as national politics is actually brilliant here.

There is a long time manipulation game that is very effective in democracies. One sends a message to people at varying levels. People who work for the targeted individual, the targeted people, as well as targets in other places that you are not directly in. You make the comments as if they were comments you heard others using, maybe talk for a little then let it go after painting it in the light you like.

When it comes up, several voices then repeat what you said from many different sources... Even though all of them were you.

Obviously this idea coming from many people in many places means it is a good idea.

You see news doing this slot now by the way where one company owning 10 news organizations will try to make it look like 10 different voices.

That approach makes sense actually.I can see this working. When I was young and dumb, I would write my state representatives about national policy issue; their responses would be like "Sorry, we have no control over that, but we'll pass your concerns onto the people who do". Maybe they never passed on anything, _but if they did_, then that means my national representatives were hearing my concerns out of the mouth of a state representative, whom they're obviously going to take more seriously since they see each other more as equals.Same here. Wrote my senator last time this shit was coming around, and got a response that just lied about what NN *actually* is and how it's soooo good for us consumers, and *that's* why they support it. But they were "thankful for my insight" or some horseshit, so they totally listened to me, right?Don't feel too bad, he undoubtedly didn't even read it and you just received a form letter than an intern wrote up. Yay for the [Congressional Apportionment Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Apportionment_Amendment) being one vote short when it was proposed!>enrage everyone into action.

What would that action be? Calling/Emailing/Writing your Senator and Congressman?Maybe he was mistaken, but my government professor told me that the reason why the banks weren't bailed out right away back in 2008 was that people were writing to Congress telling them not to.Just so you know, the faxes just arrive like a normal email would. So you can also just go ahead and email them and achieve the same result.For all those interested, check out resistbot.io or text "resist" to 50409.

This is actually an amazing service and I was dumbfounded the first time I used it. Step 1 doesn't seem to work. The Go! button always shows a 'no symbol' when my mouse is over it and when I hit enter it just goes back to "Search for your address".You can also text "resist" to 50409. It helps you write a letter to all 3 of your congress reps and then faxes the letters to them. You can also have it remind you, so you can remember to do it frequently. Call them constantly, and most importantly VOTE THEM OUT OF OFFICE. Most of them are up for re-election in 2018Raise awareness, post on facebook or other social media sites, but dont just say things like "stop the vote against net neutrality", instead actually give people information so they know what it is, how to stop it, and what to do if they cant stop it.Shut down Pornhub and Google for an hour.24 hours. No instagram, no facebook, no snapchat, no netflix, etc. Sites with subscriptions can warn people in advance and refund the day... but a day without the internet.. or better yet, a week, where different sites aren't available on different days, would really make people consider the situation. I hear "phone calls are most effective", "e-mail is most effective", and "letters are most effective" in equal measure every time contacting your representatives comes up on Reddit.quarter million dollars doesn't equal my vote!

I'm not clear on the required NN laws here, but our government is... Yeah...Canadian here with the same worries. I find my country uses the U.S as kind of a "crystal ball" for things to come.

Tech giants like Facebook and Google deliver content in a *centralized* fashion. Everything comes from them and you have little choice other than trust it. It's also the source of their income (ad revenue) and influence (market share).

Blockchain allows people to share information (or send currency like Etherum) without a middle man. No dominant web host, no forum moderator, no register of deeds. It's a trustless trust system.[I googled “eli5 blockchain”.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4yp5q1/could_you_please_eli5_the_blockchain_technology/)Not if you live in Colorado...  Bennet the democratic senator is opposed to net neutrality ~~More like, make sure you know exactly what the people you're voting for plan on doing. If you're Republican, that's fine, but don't vote someone like Trump, who explicitly says opposite things to what he said earlier in the same election cycle, without even acknowledging that he said something different.~~

EDIT: I apologize, I was really tired today and had a brain fart; I disconnected "Net Neutrality" and "Vote Democrat", and in my head saw some meaningless propoganda. Note that I am definitely democraticly-inclined, if not a democrat, but I get really annoyed when people meaninglessly spout "vote for us, we're objectively right", so with my disconnect and state of exhaustion I went off topic.Can't states create their own "Net Neutrality" provision for ISPs that operate in the state?Is it that hard to pass it as a law? Sadly, I think the collapse of all our institutions and the deaths of tens of millions are necessary to save civilization.Paper bomb their office with slightly different lettersThen don't vote for them.They don't represent us. They lord over us. They represent the rich and large corporations. That's what they do. They thank you for writing, then explain how you're wrong and they're going to vote another way. And it's certainly not the actual candidate writing and mailing those letters out, just a low-level staffer.It never hurts to voice your opinion even when it is in line with your rep’s opinion. Let him know you support it too.

It is good to keep it clear where allegiances lie. 

You can't dictate what people think in other states but you can keep YOUR state accountable.Tell your rep that you support their decision. It means a lot.It's not going to matter how big their party banks are if no one votes for them. 

As long as their opponent doesn't completely oppose the values of the state then it shouldn't be terrible to vote against them once.But my state overwhelmingly votes republican every time. Whats the point?Especially since she had policy plans to protect NN, and her party was the one who always saved it from the party who is now destroying it.Nevermind, just go to the link, click on express, and your good, my badIs there any specific killer link that we can pass on to friends in the US? Something that's going to nail the situation?Sad part, according to public information Spectrum has a profit margin of 60-90% per year (its hard to determine exactly how much because a lot of the 'business income' is written off as 'service maintenance' evne though they keep saying that 90% of the infrastructure is over 40 years out of date..This is so true. The problem is that in a lot of places, consumers only have one choice for an ISP. So it's not just cancelling with one and getting a new ISP that's better, its cancelling and having NO Internet service. They know that boycotting works, so they've done their best to kill the feasibility of that option.

Amirite? don't the ISPs agree among themselves to not compete geographically?> Tell them you want a real choice in ISP. You don't necessarily need your city to build it, but they damn sure need to let more than one ISP do it.

In most states any ISP can serve any location they want.  There is no legal barrier to competition.  It's an economic barrier.  There is no money to be made in laying cable in a place where another company already controls the market.AND take back the grid that we paid for. They've been hoarding those lines like they belong to them, but they don't!Municipal broadband is a great idea.  So good in fact that it's straight up illegal in many states, including mine.  Corporate ISPs know they can't compete with it, so they just outlawed it where they could.  This is the correct answer. Don’t assume that just because your representative is anti-NN *now* that they won’t instantly flip-flop if they think their seat is in jeopardy.Make this comment a post and make that post gp to the front page.Both of New York's senators are Democrats and strong supporters of net neutrality

We don't want to start the next world war, do we?As someone who worked for a senator, it would be phone, email, snail, and then fax.

Phone causes them to stop mid work, and start talking. And usually one of the higher ups picks up the phone.

Email adds onto the stack of emails they get anyway.

Snail mail and fax is usually gone though someone who dedicated job is doing that. Mail almost rarely read by the politician. I've also heard that going to public events they host and bringing it up is up at the top of that list if it's something you're able to doI’ve called for things I literally hear them typing and they ask me to respell my name, zip and usually clarify what bill I am referring to. I don’t have to a ton because my representatives are usually in line with my political views though. :)Then they're doing something wrong and this is not the norm.  I currently work for a congressman in California, and if, for example, someone calls and leaves a message without their name and address we absolutely follow up to get that information so we can log it properly.   I’m the grandson of former Illinois representative William Blair. Can I make a change? 

Edit: no because I’m broke as shit Do they have any system for documenting their constituents desires from Fax or email? That inside perspective would be helpful
If it's easier to do, it's easier to ignore on the receiving end. and that's why faxes and emails are ignored. They know you don't care enough to put in a real effortIf you call all your representatives as little as once a week I doubt any of them will remember you. But if they do then your words are more likely to stick, so don’t bother with changing your accent. r/UnethicalLifeProTipsThis is fantastic! Thanks for this. This should have more upvotes. I am always unsure what to say when calling for these types of things. I think with a script and all the information they have on this site, a lot more people would be willing to put for the effort to make the call. This gave me the final push i needed to call. Became a daily caller too!> https://www.battleforthenet.com

This website gives you a script and directly connects you to your representative. Yeah, extra points if you can tailor it to your congressperson. With Democrats, talk about how it preserves diversity & equality. For Republicans, talk about how it helps small business. (There is an excellent capitalist argument for NN.)[deleted]So, the best option is to tell these guys "You won't be able to watch Netflix with Comcast as your ISP"?It might be better to explain in terms of another utility. A good example would be electricity. Without net neutrality it would be like if the electric company could charge you more to power your AC unit (per kWh/h) because it was made by GE than if your AC unit was made by Kenmore regardless of efficiency. Basically, the electric company would be telling you what AC unit you'd be allowed to buy with your own money regardless of what you want. And that would be the same for every appliance in your home. Should the electric company have that much power over your spending? "Gain the ability"
You realize this already happens right? Facebook and Microsoft already invested in Marea It's only great for them if you're not willing to let go of keeping the highest tier services. To wit: Comcast for years tried to get me to buy the blast package and finally they offered a price that I said, 'why not?' I tried it and within 6 weeks got a copyright notification sent to my address stating that there would be a follow-up with the title of what was being infringed. Within 10 minutes of the e-mail, I called Comcast and cancelled the service taking me back down to the high-speed (it's not even classified as broadband anymore) economy starter 10mbps service. 

As I told the Comcast service rep, "I'm doing this so that everyone involved understands that ZERO speed is also an option.. I don't need Blast speed if it is going to be monitored. This notification strikes me rather like the phone company operators listening in on my conversations would.. Totally unacceptable.." 

To which the Comcast rep got really silent and in over a year since I've not heard a peep out of Comcast.

(and yeah, I torrent the fuck outta shit)

One foot out the door is all you need to keep them in line, but you have to be stone-cold prepared to walk out if they try to pull shit. What everyone forgets is that their *need* to sell services are far, far greater than your need to buy. 

There's nothing that you can't watch, play or listen to later.

The *customer* has the upper hand, never forget that. 

Our needs mostly are based on convenience and want while businesses need to pay investors quarterly.

Who's over a barrel here?The important part I think you’re missing in your explanation is that Netflix will turn around and raise their rates if theyre forced to pay Comcast. This means that the consumer actually ultimately ends up paying for the money grab. This is what kills innovation. When the initial costs are so high people are less willing to take risks on passion projects or market holes they might see. 

Without net neutrality there simply wouldn’t have ever been Netflix. They never would have been able to pay content creators and an isp. Well they did have something like that back in july saying how we should protect net neutrality, but that wasn’t a shutdown just a big banner saying we should be aware of it.Well, the first thing that we could do is get subreddits to shut down first, to bring attention to people on reddit about NN. Not everyone cares about a banner, but if major subreddits are shut down, it could get people to worry.

If a lot of subreddits close, it would be easier and more effective to get reddit itself to show support. We could even begin with PMing or emailing Reddit admins to make ALL of Reddit shutdown.

If you own a small site, service, or anything that has a fanbase or following, you could alert them to NN. 

But even more importantly, talk about NN publicly, on social media, with your friends, on your discord, GET PEOPLE AWARE AND WORRIED. No one will ever fight this if they have no idea what it is, and banners and shutdowns can only do so much. Inform people, and make them care. Tell them how it will effect facebook, twitter, myspace, how it will effect their internet bill. People will only care if they are in jeopardy; sad, but true.Here ya go!https://www.battleforthenet.com/http://www.battleforthenet.com has a banner you can put on your site that automatically comes up for visitors.It's not that people are refusing, its just that this is a fight that never ends.  We won then, and it's coming up again now.  If we win now, it'll come up again in a few years.  They're slowly wearing us down because we're only human, and it takes way more effort on our part to stop them than it does for them to keep on pushing.I am not from the US, and it's wearing ME down!Because the big sites took a stance and shut the fuck down. That pushed everyone else to action. Netflix isn’t the target of a shutdown, Twitter needs to be the target. Remember we have a President who lives, breathes and would likely experience real loss if Twitter were taken away from him for a day or more. 

Personally, shut all the majors down. All social networks, all service sites, bring the sites to a crawl, redirect them all to a “tier upgrade” page telling them the internet is about to turn into this. Shove it in their faces again and again until they leave it alone. I believe I once got a stock letter from (i.e. his interns) where they didn't even bother to replace the [fill in constituent name] fields with my actual name.Depends. Generally on the phone you will have an unpaid intern answering and just inputting your name, address, and position on the issue into the computer. The letter will likely make its way to the staff person responsible for that issue area so they can craft a response, if they have not yet already done so.I called Dan Sullivan 26 times in the last year. A good half of those times were for issues like Betsy Devos' confirmation. I got to an actual person twice. On issues like the Devos confirmation I never even got an answering machine despite trying multiple times throughout the day.

I got the same treatment from Don Young.

As much as I don't like Lisa Murkowski's positions, every time I've called her office I've gotten a person, usually an intern and about half the time they actually tell me what I want to know.

As far as I'm concerned Dan Sullivan and Don Young can go fuck themselves. I am your constituent and if you're too much of a pussy to face the outlash from your decisions you can take a long walk off a short pier. It's fucking disgusting.This is a great idea.  I'm guessing it would hit too close to home for most people and just cause a bunch of uproar that people have no idea how to focus.  The big companies will come out and claim that 'they would never do that...' and demonize the sites taking this action.      Yet, it would give a taste of what is possible.  This is a pretty decent ideaThis is a fantastic idea. I wish this was the #1 comment. I know not everyone would do it, but can you imagine if Facebook actually shut down for a day? Or Netflix shut down for a day? Or Amazon. People would get talking awfully fast. Don't bother with the explanation. Simply restate your position: The politician who supports net neutrality gets your vote, end of story. It doesn't matter what the rationale is, getting votes is what politicians seek.Small businesses especially will be hurt by this, since they won't be able to pay the higher fees that Internet providers will charge those small businesses to host their website.No, they do understand. They're pitching bullshit so they can get paid.Mia Love.

I read you loud and clear. Doesn't matter if you don't vote for them. You're given x or y options, and realistically, x or y are the only ones allowed to win. The parties are too big and too powerful for an independent to win.

You vote for candidate J because he's not part of the system? Guess what, you and everyone who saw your little thing did too. But everyone who saw it pales in comparison to the people who saw all the adverts. The people who saw the half-truths and whole lies slung about on TV, they don't give a fuck about your candidate. Chances are, they've never heard of him.You can't realistically expect one person to listen to the voices of up to [nearly 1 million constituents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_congressional_districts#Population). It's physically impossible.You keep saying that. "If no one votes for them." That's a fantasy. They will ALWAYS own the votes. The two-party system doesn't exist to ensure you have at least two options, it exists to make sure you ONLY have two options.Local elections matter more than you think.  Many of those only get a few thousand votes total, so you can make a real difference by organizing with friends & coworkers in you community.  And you'd be surprised at how often candidates for local positions run unopposed.

(And on the opposite side, Colorado, a fairly blue state, has a solid conservative in Cory Gardner; Illinois had a Republican senator until last year.) Sanity willing, even freakin' Alabama is about to elect a Democratic senator (please please God please).

State elections can swing in weird ways. You should always vote.Vote in **every**. **single**. **election**. National, state, local, doesn't matter.

The political environment right now is such that nearly every single republican seat is up for grabs. Dems have flipped seats that went 40 points in favor of Trump to winning by 1% [Oklahoma SD-37](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/11/14/1715575/-A-OK-in-Oklahoma-Democrats-flip-their-14th-special-election-from-red-to-blue-on-Tuesday). Right now control of VA's House of Delegates (which was not expected to be contested *at all*) is coming down to recounts in 3 districts that are being decided by only a few hundred votes.

Even if if local races aren't going to affect the issues you're most concerned about (net neutrality or healthcare or w/e), it builds the bench so that you will have stronger candidates and more winnable races down the line. The Tea Party, for instance, started organizing in 2006, which is how they were able to win so many races in 2010.[removed]What does 'proceedings' mean?WHY.

Like Jesus fucking Christ. Outlawing things like this is one of the dumbest fucking things you can do. It's unnecessary and just straight up stupid.

Edit: apparently I forgot how to spell "fucking".
Wilson got grandfathered in.I love the area of Asheville, but I really hate this state. Seriously considering living in Tennessee just over the mountain.Yes, after Greenlight completed the project Cox and TWC lobbied the state legislature HARD and convinced them to ban it.  Greenlight / City of Wilson is grandfathered but no others will be able to start up in NC until that law changes.

What's really stupid is the city actually approached Cox/TWC and said we are blowing the fiber, you just need to provide faster speed at a lower cost (since the infrastructure will be built and maintained by the city).  Big cable said no way, so the city went ahead and built their own IP TV, internet and VoIP provider.  A power company managed to do this in a tiny NC town...I live in Ayden which is about 15 mins away from Greenville. There is one isp here, century link. I pay 45$ for 10/1. I feel like I’m in a third world country. My fiancé and I can’t both be on the internet at the same time. This shit should be illegal. How can I get better internet when the ISPs have zoned off the counties?It's North Carolina. IIRC they don't even have SLAPP laws in that state and it's a popular state for businesses to base themselves out of (or claim to base themselves out of) in order to avoid negative internet press, because they could sue you and mire you in legal fees if you tried.No, that would be a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.

However, they will never compete geographically because it's not profitable to do so.  The only exceptions are new entrants like Google Fiber, which spend a ton of money entering an established market and usually fail.In most municipalities there are very, very significant barriers to entry.  Usually a mix of:

Monopoly access to poles/easements for existing ISPs, usually in exchange for free government infrastructure (city offices, schools, hospitals)

Monopoly for X years in exchange for 100% infrastructure saturation in the city

Extremely high fees for pole/easement access, essentially ensuring a monopoly

Extremely high "franchise fees" (cash kickbacks) for any new ISP

In many cases, municipal restrictions can more than *double* the infrastructure cost for a new ISP.

One reason Google chose Kansas City to launch is because there are almost no barriers.  Missouri is single license (meaning one license allows a company to install infrastructure anywhere in the state).  There are almost no access fees and saturation isn't required, so they can offer their service piecemeal.

Even before Google Fiber, there were half a dozen different ISPs in KC offering competitive options at reasonable prices.  Now, there are nearly a dozen options in many places in the metro, and half a dozen offering fiber.I wish everyone knew that. The most infuriating part is the infrastructure is already public property, Its been paid for a few times over! So for them to say they need more for our increased traffic is complete bullshit. The isp's attack on municipal internet should be considered oppression of some sort. Companies aren't supposed to have that much influence over government!Better to lose one donor than the entire gig On the flip-side, don't think that just because they appeal to the will of the voters that they'll follow any of their claims.Haha.  You think that representatives listen to their constituents.  How cute.

Whenever I see these protests I'm like "yo I gotta study" or wondering how these people can get time off work. speaking of voting, why do other countries get to have referendums where the actual public votes on big issues.

Where is the fun in that? This way you can practice your impersonations and improv skills while also fighting for/against(I always forget which way is good and which is bad) net neutrality.From the website:

Introduce yourself, be polite, and say: I support "Title Two" net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. Specifically, I'd like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand he abandon his current plan.That is essentially Net Neutrality - aka, the way the internet works right now. Overturning Net Neutrality would allow companies to legally compete unfairly, in the method you just mentioned.As I understand it, Netflix wouldn't be able to sue ISP's for not delivering their content. To put it in an different context: Delivery couriers don't sue the goverment / cities for having road maintenance, road congestion and such.

With current laws, they can sue the ISP if there is notable proof of the ISP actually slowing down traffic to the customer. However, when the new vote turns out to abandon the concept of Net Neutrality, there would be no legal ground for Netflix to stand on. 

(Warning: Not US Citizen)> couldn’t Netflix just sue them if it was figured out

You’ve just described what net neutrality is. That’s what might not exist in a few weeks. They could (and would) now, but not in a world without Net Neutrality. More likely, Comcast will charge you more for using Netflix.Analogies are good, the problem is that many people consider them to be equivalencies.

Internet is a mix of analogous elements from the mail service, power, water, aircraft design, etc.

No one analogy fits, yet whenever you try and use one to explain an aspect of the Internet, people take other aspects of that analogy that don't work, and try and apply them as evidence that net neutrality is bad.

So my warning is that if you are using an analogy, be prepared with multiple analogies and why you need multiple ones.> Marea

Woah, I hadn't heard about this. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAREAAgree with you wholeheartedly. If NN is abolished then I will be going on a major internet diet. Not going to support that bullshit.

Also, if you torrent a lot you should get a VPN.What if you only have one ISP in your area?


Also, without Internet some people can't work, so it's not just based on want. I couldn't work without Internet, but I'm lucky enough to have many ISPs available, and I switched them twice because they didn't listen to many phone calls about shitty service. They do change their attitude and fix problems after you cancel though. Would they fix it if every other ISP were the same?


Not from US, but I'm not looking forward to losing NN in US anyway, that could turn nasty for many more countries with greedy ISPs and corrupted politicians.Most people won't do that.  It's the same with gas prices.  Yeah people drive a little less, but they are still using 80-90% of what they usually do.  The modern lifestyle is too woven around the technology at this point to just stop.  Good for you if you can do it though.  

I guess seeing how this issue pops up so often, we should always be aware of it.Want the fun part. 

I personally put together a sub and started messaging over 300 large subs. And I did not copy paste a single message. I wrote each one and WHY it mattered to THEIR SPECIFIC USERS to work together and do more than just a stupid banner. r/technology was the only sub that gave me a real response. 

All of the others were like fuck no, we don't do this, and never will

We also need an ELI5 version of why this is a problem, because a lot of us hear “net neutrality” and we know there’s an issue around it, but we don’t understand well enough to educate others in a meaningful way.

Or at least, I don’t. Maybe I’m just a moron. But, I’m a moron who wants to help.We won a few times already. At this point we can make a fucking holiday out of our government trying to fuck the internet. It comes around every year seemingly.I don't know if you still have that letter or not, but you should put it online. The job of politicians is to listen to their constituents and push policies that their constituents want. That's it. If our politicians can't even pay enough attention to the voters to have their interns write a letter with your actual name than they should be publicly shamed and voted out. For bonus points, find large surveys / petitions and tell her how many people care the same way / will vote accordingly. Remember to cite your sources.Sounds like a pornstarHas anyone told you she sounds like a porn star?> Mia Love

A Republican, what a surprise.Is your congresswoman a pornstar?  Writing your representative will not do anything, they do not care. 

Now, informing them that their fuckery has caused to actively campaign for and fund raise for their opponent (whomever that may be) will be a stronger message. Assuming of course you actually do those things.It couldn't hurt to let her know you approve of her actions. I bet politicians hardly ever hear that.Absolutely. Call in and voice your support of her position.Yes! Dear god yes. Positive reinforcement is a great weapon against bribery.

I play villains a lot in role playing games and on stage and I kid you not the single most effective way of turning anyone and everyone to my cause no matter how terrible is "I appreciate what you do. I know you are a good person and I know you work hard. I am sorry they don't see that. If you ever want someone that is willing to listen to you, come talk to me."

Unconditional positive regard, understanding and appreciation are more effective tools than any amount of money.

The best weapon against them is genuine appreciation and positive regard.UK guy here. Is that the time of Brexit being official?Guess what. In the U.K. we don’t have net neutrality by law. Why? Because our law makers are happy with our current rules that make it so ISPs have to be explicitly clear what they block (even court ordered blocked websites are listed so you can appeal the decision if you wish), what and when they slow down traffic, and as long as you have choice between choosing a ISP that does and an ISP that doesn’t why should the government step in.

It’s more obvious with mobile ISPs but some networks sign up deals with Skype, NetFlix, Spotify so their services don’t count towards the data limits of customers. The fine print of your service will limit / block you on tethering (if it’s allowed at all).

But even fixed line ISPs can slow down traffic if they are clear about it (Virgin Media have the right  to and have done in the past (refuse to use them to know if they still do) slow down BitTorrent traffic if they want.

This is they you started seeing more “totally unlimited” in ISPs advertising as some ISPs won’t slow you down or limit your usage. 

The governments stance on the matter is as long as their are ISPs that are “totally unlimited”, the ones who aren’t are clear about how they are not to customers then they do not yet need to step in and regulate.I'm not a registered Democrat this is why I dislike the two party system I don't agree with everyone the democratic party does or the Republican party Nope, fucking us all over is solidly part of the (R) plan.Crossing my fingers for schoolhouse Rock...

There are some issues where you're going to find similar stances on booth sides of the aisle, but if net neutrality is your issue then you should be voting Democrats into office at the local and national levels. Look at the voting records for the last, what, eight times(?) net neutrality has come up--with the exception of a handful of Congresspersons, the Democrats have consistently voted to protect net neutrality while the Republicans have consistently voted to do away with it. There is a chance that you could be in a district where both the possible Democrat and Republican up for election are not in favor of net neutrality, but by the numbers it's a statistically small chance and it's more likely that people are just parroting the idea that both parties are the same on all the important issues because they're either too damn lazy to do their own research, or because they feel they need to justify their apathy toward participate in our democracy in any meaningful way.If you actively vote for an independent and get them above the 5% threshold to get recognition it's worth while.

Sure, for now it's x or y, but eventually you can get an independent. He'll now that Sanders has recognition he could go back to being an independent and could probably beat out a Democrat presidential candidate.But that doesn't mean they should completely disregard them.Because the ISPs lobbied them to do it. Something about stifling competition. So basically nobody can do what Wilson did, and the point is moot.Chattanooga has fiber optics municipally owned, 10/10 would recommend > Monopoly access to poles/easements for existing ISPs, usually in exchange for free government infrastructure (city offices, schools, hospitals)

That is a violation of federal law.  Access to utility poles and easements has to be made available on an equal basis.

> Monopoly for X years in exchange for 100% infrastructure saturation in the city

Again illegal under federal law.  This was common in the 80s but has been banned since the 1992 Cable Act.


> Extremely high fees for pole/easement access, essentially ensuring a monopoly

That's definitely a concern.

> Extremely high "franchise fees" (cash kickbacks) for any new ISP

Franchise fees have to be the same as they are for the incumbent.

> In many cases, municipal restrictions can more than double the infrastructure cost for a new ISP.

Very true.

> One reason Google chose Kansas City to launch is because there are almost no barriers. Missouri is single license (meaning one license allows a company to install infrastructure anywhere in the state). There are almost no access fees and saturation isn't required, so they can offer their service piecemeal.

Yes, Google definitely was looking for lower levels of regulation.  By creating public excitement for their product, they convinced cities that having Google Fiber would be worth more to the city than the money they receive from incumbents.  

> Even before Google Fiber, there were half a dozen different ISPs in KC offering competitive options at reasonable prices. Now, there are nearly a dozen options in many places in the metro, and half a dozen offering fiber.

I think most of these are resellers.  They simply repackage service provided by the owner of the lines.  Welcome to post Supreme Court ruling on Citizens United v FECCompanies and corporations basically *are* the government. That's why you make very clear that your vote is contingent on their voting recordI just donated....to the American one.I got confused, and sent guns to the electronic frontier foundation, so you're safe...for now.Too late... the damage has been done.That’ll be a lovely bodybag job for the Metropolitan PD. I go to as many protests as I can. The main thing is finding a group youh genuinely enjoy being around so it's not a chore to protest. Thered no shame in missing some of them, but our society is geared towards making protesting incredibly difficult, so we gotta do it whenever we can.We do, it’s just at the state level. Where other countries give the vast majority of power to the federal level, the US gives more power to the state level and only steps in to correct a fuck up via the Supreme Court. That’s why states are voting for medical and recreational use for marijuana instead of having nationwide voting.

Note: I’m no expert in history/government/politics/et cetera. If my understanding of this process is misleading or incorrect, please let me know.Referendums are generally state wide. For example, Massachusetts voted to legalize recreational marijuana last year.There might be in a week.Glitter bombing is anything but harmless. *Cue traumatic flashbacks.*"Ajit Pai bans glitter neutrality"Yea Tonko/Gillibrand/Schumer’s staff are all pretty great. I’m super lucky. I've been a hill intern and there literally is a system (developed by Lockheed-Martin) to type in a constituents concerns. Its really cool, looked up friends and family and there were calls/letters/emails they'd written in going back years. 

It's not Narnia, its reality. There’s probably somewhere you could take that if you wanted to. The red tape would slow it down too much to matter though.I'm not too legally versed but aren't anti trust legalities already set in place to prevent something like thisI think a company could sue the city if they found out the city government was deliberately sabotaging their attempts to deliver packages. 

It's not just incidental traffic that Net Nutrality prevents (since incidental traffic happens no matter what, internet or highways) - It's the deliberate congestion or entire halt of reaching certain businesses and services.

Like the city making an agreement with TGI Friday's and putting up road blocks and fake construction sites on all the roads and sidewalks that led to Applebees to stop customers from attending. I'm not a Lawyer, but I'm fairly certain Applebees could sue the city for that. They won't do that, that's too obvious. It's in their best interest to keep the people in the dark about how they're being fucked by the loss of NN.

What they WILL do is charge Netlflix an absurd amount to access their customers. Netflix will be forced to cut their budget for programming to pay the ransom or else they'll have to raise their rates. It will eventually piss Netflix's customers off and they'll move to Hulu which isn't being extorted by Comcast (because Comcast owns Hulu).

Customers won't be any the wiser to what Comcast did, they'll blame Netflix for all of it.abstractions are inherently leakyThat's what i thought. Im interested in the movement of treating ISP as a municipal utility.Me either holy shit.[deleted]What’d the r/technology mods say?I'm mod of a very small subreddit but I'd love to help out if I can.What is the sub? I want to subscribeNet Neutrality keeps the internet looking like a basic freeway.  It doesn't matter what car you drive, or how many people are in it, or what your license plate says, or how expensive your wiper blades are, you and everyone else has the exact same speed limit.

Without it, we get a system of tiered Toll Roads.  Most people are on the same freeway, but it's speed limit 30 instead of 65.  If you pay extra, you can get speed limit 45, and pay even more you can get speed limit 65.  A few people pay even more and get their own super special lane.  This is actually your lane, but if they want to drive, you get moved automatically to a slower lane until they pass you and then you're allowed to use the lane you're paying for again.

Oh yeah, and if your car wasn't made by the company that owns the toll road, you always drive slower.

lastly, some of the exits require special permits, so you can't just take the internet toll road to whatever website you want.  Instead you have to pay $5 a month to be able to access social media exists, or $2 a month for search engines that aren't Bing, or $25 a month for the privilege of paying HBo another $15 a month to stream HBO.

Does that help?Yep they try to conveniently push this through a bit before winter recesss and after elections so they won't have to deal with consequences or backlash and have no risk to their jobs.

There's no more lists.  They monitor everyone now.Every year there's a couple above that threshold. I couldn't tell you their names, and likely no one can, because they don't get news clips. They don't get interviews. They don't get exposure.You mean the ISPs don't care about capatilism and a free market? What a shock!The internet is basically a utility now. If anything it should be City run like any other utility. For modern-day American Life the internet is almost as essential as having running water. I would be more than happy to redirect some of my taxes away from fighting to put marijuana users in jail and put it towards city-wide internetAnd the Tennessee legislature outlawed immediately afterwards to prevent anyone else from doing itThey're set to be overturned as well. This is how internet providers can be the only available option in an area. And that's what net neutrality is. 

*Now* imagine if the city doesn't have to listen to Applebee's. Or only listens to them if Applebee's coughs up some money.You are quite literally defining what net neutrality is.  With net neutrality if Netflix for example finds out that Comcast is slowing their service to a crawl while not doing the same to say Hulu, Netflix has every right to sue.  If net neutrality is removed, netflix will have no legal recourse and Comcast can extort them for money, and they did when this first became a problem.

https://consumerist.com/2014/02/23/netflix-agrees-to-pay-comcast-to-end-slowdown/

Comcast extorted money from netflix because due to their physical location at the time all their traffic had to go over comcast lines.Oh, they'll definitely charge Netflix and other content providers.  No question.

But I've heard speculation that they will _also_ charge the customers, and I believe there's some early evidence that this is happening already.  I mean, they're in a position to do both.Even easier is to just not tell anyone anything and Comcast could start making traffic to Netflix run slower than traffic to Hulu.  Customers will eventually get pissed that Netflix never seems to work well for them and this will drive customers away from Netflix and into the arms of a competing service like Hulu, who just happens to be owned by the company responsible for making your Netflix connection slow.Imagine if Facebook shut down for a day. People wouldn't just write to their representatives, they would straight up revolt.They were all for it and in fact offered to help lead the charge It's dead. I was thinking of remaking it but I can't do it alone and that's how it honestly felt when I started the project. 

I've run large groups before, from 200+ player Minecraft servers to full blown 3k highly active user forums(as in average user posts 15+ times a day), never felt as rejected as when I tried to start the sub up The worst part is that net neutrality is a public good and good for all but about four or five companies who just happen to have a lot of money and power to peddle their alternate reality. My congressman had a completely wrong view about it, but as a Republican I don't think he can be convinced.The UK will never be out of the EU in a way that would make sense to your average Brexit voter.

As for NN... I'd like to know when are we going to get it?Great. Sometimes I wish I could move to continental Europe. The only problems are money and family here.

I'm fed up of the sorry state of politics in this country. Brexit will probably be the worst mistake the public have made in a long time. I know it's technically goes against the public vote, but I wish there was a way to reverse it or something.

Sorry about this, I just wanted to get it out.If they are above that threshold they qualify for federal support for campaigning.Actually, this is exactly what capitalism and a free market is giving them. In this case, they are pursuing their capitalism mandated sanction to make as much money as they want, letting the market be “free” of regulation. To them, a “free market” is quite literally a market that lets them do whatever they want. And that’s what it is with a lot of people I’ve spoken to and have heard talk about free markets.

After all, pure capitalism would have no government influence, which would mean there would be no laws against monopolies forming. And that’s what corporation seem to want.I like this guy.Better idea, start telling every Madden, COD, WoW, GTA, Overwatch and every other online game fan that you know that Comcast can, and probably will, start charging them huge fees just to access XboxLive or PSN, on top of those services raising fees to pay Verizon, Comcast, and all the others the new access fees that MS and Sony will be charged.

If that doesn't work, tell them that the equal ground of games will go away and while their latency is in the hundreds of milliseconds, their competitors could be zero because they have more $$$ to spend on "fastlanes."  No more high speed = high speed, instead "It's I have $1m and you don't so I will always win because you will never have a good connection."They certainly will try, I'm sure, but it won't be obvious at first. It'll be something like "see Netflix in 4K for and extra $2 a month!" Not "Netflix access package $14 a month". It will eventually get there, but not immediately.

If they piss off their customers too fast they'll immediately call for the return of NN. They don't want that, they want people to forget the term entirely. They will ease customers into the trap not drop them right in.

They're smart enough not to crank the heat up on the frog all at once, it'll just jump out of the pot. You have to boil it slowly.Facebook doesn't support net neutrality though; they're basically trying to create a tiered internet in India and Africa that prioritizes facebook.If Facebook shut down for a day because US politics are being stupid again I imagine the rest of their users around the world would be more pissed at Facebook, same with almost every other website that has users around the globe. This is my problem with all of those websites purporting to oppose NN, such as Amazon, Google, etc.  You know what a banner ad on your website does?  Fucking nothing.  You know what shutting down your website for an entire day at the cost of some profits does?  Incites hundreds of thousands if not millions of people.  These companies need to put their money where their mouths are if they actually give a shit about net neutrality, but until then they're not doing anything more than virtue signaling.It's called a ddos attack and even you mr.average Joe can help out by downloading orbital ion cannon to a computer near you!Good on them! Let’s make it happen! I’m gonna write to my senators right now. Well as an economist I think it's especially hilarious that Republicans want to do this because it's fundamentally opposed to the principles of capitalism.

The most basic principle of capitalism is having a fair and even playing field. Allowing competitors to control access to a market is literally legislating a market failure into your economy.

It's in EU law, so just make sure when the next election gets called in a year or two, and reps start knocking, you ask about this. Then we get on change.org and say we want Jedi recognised as a religi- no wait I mean we want NN laws.I know. It's such bullshit.

They lied for fucks sake. Literally hours after the vote they admitted that £350bn wasn't going to the NHS. The biggest argument they had, plastered on buses, and they admitted they lied.
The whole thing should be discounted because the public were misled.

I'm so bloody angry about it still.

We voted to "take back control" from an unelected elite in Brussels, and we gave that control to an unelected elite in Westminster instead. So now we're left with a Prime Minister devoted to brexit with no actual fucking plan. Our foreign secretary is Boris. Fucking. Johnson.

We're fucked. Absolutely, royally, fucked.Which is like 1/20th of what PACs and Super PACs do.The part I always find most ironic about these statements is that they always say the private sector can do it better, faster, and cheaper.  Yet god forbid there be competition from the government.A lot of states have bans on city run cable or at least have to sell them off after a while. There's nothing free about a market that imposes anti-competitive restrictions on stuffJust imagine, with no governmental interference, they could hire kids to dig trenches to lay the fiber in for pennies on the dollar and we'd have fiber that much quicker!Actually this is not capatialism or a free market. If it were government would not be able to intervene on the company's behalf giving them an unnatural monopoly. It's crony capitalism. It is government picking winners and losers not the market which is us. Guess I'll sit back now and wait for the down votes to come.Exactly. Fuck Marc Zuckerberg and fuck Facebook.
Facebook needs to die.Google is the internet God. If they were to make a fake paywall with several different options for what kinds of search results they would get as part of packages and at the bottom there would be a link to the free internet.

That's not a ddos.

Sure, Orbital Ion Cannon will potentially take down the site. 
It will the be portrayed by the media as online hackers doing damage and average users won't give a shit beyond cursing "those damn hackers".

You'd be preaching to the choir.
The only people who'd pay enough attention to get the point about NN in a ddos attack are those who already agree with you.    A fair field for everyone? Sounds like commie talk to me! Every red blooded American knows that businesses know what is heat so obviously they will govern best!

/sIt'd still be more than 0You just gave me an idea. Since the "free market" can apparently do everything cheaper and better than the government it would be a great idea to have the government compete everywhere. Except the gov aims to provide the service as good as possible and offers it at cost. If the "free market" is actually betfer than the government it'll provide the same service with the same quality at the same price or lower. Citizens can only profit.The only competition capitalists want is between workers to drive labor costs down. So, you’d be fine if they could have a “natural” monopoly? Honestly, I feel like capitalism in general is pretty corrupt. You either have the government setting laws or repealing laws based on lobbyists, or you have a laissez-faire where corporations can do whatever they want and we just hope they don’t do shady stuff (because there will be people that buy products even if they are made unethically, or there is something unethical about them; see Electronic Arts and it’s gambling loot boxes and the people buying their games without even batting an eye at it as a modern day example). Either we need to fix it, or replace it.Then stop using itMarc fuckerburglol, this is actually brilliant, but someone pointed out already how the average internetizen is so dam dum they wouldn't understand itAnd worse it could be billed as an example that bad people who attack sites want NN, are you a bad person?Plus that's a guaranteed way to get the feds to come looking for you
The near-monopoly clearly knows what is best for its competitors. 

In the interest of fair competition we will be increasing prices on any website which is critical of us. Additionally due to the amount of traffic stock trading causes we have decided to throttle all stock market activity within our network, except purchases of our shares. Selling our company's stock is still subject to bandwidth restrictions however.I'll use my college and not my high school because nothing really noteworthy happened in high school.

At Northeastern University, [ten tons of concrete fell four stories from the facade of a school-owned dorm onto the sidewalk of the busy street that the university is centered on (Huntington Avenue)](http://www.bostonherald.com/news_opinion/local_coverage/2009/07/disaster_averted_northeastern_building_collapse). This street is as heavily traveled by pedestrians as any on campus, and is pretty typical of a Boston sidewalk on a typical day (i.e. not Lansdowne Street before a Red Sox game but not some neighborhood sidewalk on a residential street either). It was 8:15am when it happened. 

Somehow, no one was on that sidewalk, and no one was hurt. It was a Tuesday IIRC, and orientation was happening, which consists of lots of group tours/walks around campus. Simply amazing. Would have been catastrophic for the school if even one person was injured. The biggest incident was when my school decided to get rid of block scheduling, it was basically taking 4 classes for the first part of the year and then 4 different classes at the second part so a total of 8 classes per school year. When the school district decided to get rid of block scheduling and goto traditional 6 classes a day all year the students protested. This text when around to almost every student in the school and almost the entire student body gathered in the middle of the school for a "peaceful protest" it ended up us watching kids running hysterically from the cops who were fully suited up in riot gear and kids getting tased. It was definitely an event.Four kids stole a van, lined it up with the main entrance, and put a brick on the accelerator.  The ensuing fire kept us out of school for a few days.  They were caught after tweeting about doing it, IIRC.My high school teacher always used to tell us in private that there was something wrong with the band teacher, but couldn’t quite pinpoint it- he always seemed too close to the students. 

More than a decade later, [said band teacher was caught making inappropriate contact with students.](http://www.fox5dc.com/news/fairfax-county-school-band-director-sentenced-to-12-years-in-prison) I went to a private Catholic college prep high school in Florida. Freshman year my elderly, male principal was arrested for soliciting sex to an undercover male officer. Sophomore year we went into lockdown as police raided our tiny school - computer teacher and computers left with the police and he was charged with over 100 counts of child pornography. Junior year our male PE coach was caught during mass having sex with a sophomore girl. I didn’t attend for my senior year.....Back in 92 or 93 when I was in high school we had some kids involved in suicide pacts. Tragic and 2 teens died before it got stopped.2 guys got in a fight over a girl/ex girl. One stabbed the other. He died. A teacher at my middle school was asked to retire early a few years ago. This happened in my sophomore year of high school so I wasn’t there to see it happen, but apparently some kid walked into her class and shouted “What bullshit are we learning today!?!?” and she backhanded him right across his face. 
Kids stole a bust of the guy who donated the new gym to our school. They would take take pictures of him around the "world" with obviously fake scenic backgrounds from Hawaii and mount Rushmore and would all say wish you were here but then the school threatened to involve the FBI over the morning annoucements and the kids returned the bust the next day in the principal's parking spot.

Edit: clarification

Edit 2: a bust is a sculpture of someone's head, for those that don't knowFor several months running, some kid would piss on the radiators a couple times a week. It was horrid.Someone decided to let off a canister of pepper spray. 
Me and a group of friends discovered it had been set off in a stair way were we used to hang at break time, because we were choking and coughing non stop. Alerted staff,  but it wasn't until lunch time when we came back from the gym that there was police, ambulances and helicopters all over the school. They didn't know what the gas was and suddenly everyone needed to be seen by a doctor and was kept inside the classrooms. Parents were turning up and creating a mob outside. Two dad's got into a fight near the police helicopter that had landed in our field and got arrested.  News crews turned up and everything. 

*EDIT:spelling An English teacher had a year+ long affair with an 11th grade girl. He was transferred to a junior high while we were in grade 12, and their relationship continued; they would prance around the halls after hours at the junior high which was caught on camera and how he was busted (not so smart). 

Apparently, she was living in an apartment at the time due to rough home life, and her boyfriend would come by, they’d have sex, he’d leave, then the teacher would come over with groceries for her, they’d have sex, and the cycle continued for months, unbeknownst to the bf. 

He was arrested the year after high school; of course his homelife with his wife and 2 kids was ruined. I learned all of this about 4 years after high school when I ran into the former bf at a bar and he filled me in about everything, pretty crazy.Someone dressed up like a ninja and stabbed a kid with a machete in the woods behind the high school.

(This was after I graduated, so I don't know much more than these bare details.)This kid I went to middle school with was the first juvenile in my state to be tried as an adult at age 12. He murdered his friends stepdad.Girl in year 11 (15-16 years old) got pregnant by her boyfriend that was 18. He then gets mad at her for going out with other boys or something then strangles her with a scarf and leaves her for dead. Neither the girl or the baby survived after being in hospital for a while, made national news and everything.There was a teacher who had left my school and went to work at another school the year after I was in their class. The teacher performed a science experiment that went horribly wrong without the proper safety procedures and ended up setting a student on fire. 

Edit: To clarify, this did not happen at my high school. It happened at the school the teacher transferred to. This was in NYC.This kid my junior year poked the head of his dick out of his pants during the football pictures. No one noticed till the yearbooks came out and he was almost charged as a sex offender. Made national news.My high school had its name, Newport, spelled in big letters in front of the school. Our rival school came and rearranged it to WETPORN and it went unnoticed for quite a while. This was quite a while ago but the legend of WETPORN standsWe had someone a couple of years above me who was murdered. That was a pretty horrible day after that. We were all taken into assemblies and told about what happened and told to speak to the staff if we needed anyone to talk to. There was also councillors walking around the school for a couple of weeks in case anyone needed them. They actually handled the situation really well if I'm honest. 

There was a lot of fundraising events in the guys name after the event, in particular a students v teachers football match where his family were invited as guests. My school’s music teacher gambled away thousands of dollars that the students had raised to help them attend competitions. Now they can’t have nice things.That show True Life on MTV? First episode ever was about heroin addiction, filmed at my high school.Kid brought a gun to school in middle school. School went into lockdown while the kid was going through the halls banging on doors. Planned on shooting people but brought the wrong bullets for his gun. Ran outside and got tackled by police. Now he works at McDonald's and does tattoos from a kit. 

Edit: kid was adopted from Russia, his actual plan was to go to Russia after school to kill his real parents, only someone bullied him during the day, causing him to grab the gun from his locker and start wrecking havoc.I went to a military boarding school. A kid (A) who got into UCLA (IIRC) with a scholarship got into a fight with this other kid (B) over A's girlfriend. A was dismissed from the school, which was a synonym for expelled. For whatever reason B was allowed to stay. After he received the news, A went around saying goodbye and giving hugs, then went to the top floor of a dorm during our free hours and jumped head first to his death. It was very tragic and very hushed by the academy. In high school there was this random day where everyone started passing out from an "odor" that came from one of the hallways, I forgot what subject the class was.  Anyway, people were being sent to the hospital where they had setup a station for everyone to shower before they went into the ER?  It was weird as hell.  I tried to find it online but it's in the archives.Art teacher had a hidden camera in the girls bathroom and one of them found it. When the cops came he fled on foot but they caught him. 

Edit: this blew up so I’ll include some more info that helps answer some questions. 

He had his own single stall bathroom in the art room that he would primarily let the girls use to change in/use the bathroom after their PE class. So there was no mistaking who’s camera it was when it was discovered. 
Freshman year of high school, 1987, multiple students killed in 3 separate car vs train accidents.

Never try to beat the train, kids. Kid had a brain aneurysm in class.  A classmate performed cpr on him until the paramedics arrived. Was brain dead for a week before the parents let him go.  It was the incident that got our school defibrillators. 

Edit: obviously,  a defibrillator wouldn't help a brain aneurysm. Most people only knew that he had stopped breathing and his heart had stopped. 

Edit 2: I am aware that defibrillators won't help a stopped heart either. This was an incident that sparked the district's awareness that they were ill-prepared for health crises like these. Even though a defribullator is unhelpful in most cases for high school aged children, most parents were satisfied to see the school taking some measures to prevent the death of children. I feel like there were many incidents at my school that were a big deal in hindsight but were treated nonchalantly. For example, we had a student who told everyone these elaborate stories about how she was kidnapped one time. Everyone made fun of her for lying and trying to get attention; she was bullied pretty badly. Turns out, she really was kidnapped.  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯Some of these stories are shocking and unreal. 

Meanwhile, the only interesting thing to ever happen at my old school is that once a dog got inside and it was running up and down the corridors and everyone was petting it. I attended just a pretty small town school in rural Yorkshire, UK.

Edit 1: This incident was primary school. I was in year 5 so it would've been in like 2001 or 2002 I was nine at the time. The dog breed as far as I can remember was some kind a miniature Shetland sheep dog. It looked basically like a miniature lassie dog. 

Edit 2: Also forgot At secondary school our head teacher ran over her laptop in her car. This happened when I was in year 8, so would've been about 2006. Apparently it was an accident, but we never did get the full story on that one.A principal in the 70s killed a teacher and her kids. It was horrific. There’s a book about it and a mini series. My film and TV history teacher was friends with the murdered teacher and would screen the movie. No one ever talked about it and it’s creepy as fuck. Last year somebody sent in a presumed bomb threat.... on a day when school was out.        
        Edit: Just to add, there was no actual bomb and they never found out who sent the threatThere were a couple of groups that were having fights every day after school.  So for a couple of weeks, the city police would surround the school every day right before we got out.  It was kind of funny walking out of school and there's police cars everywhere.Hallway monitor got caught sleeping with a female sophomore. Students dad walked in mid-sex.

Also, a few kids ~~tried~~ **DID** join Isis + died 

link: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.gomn.com/.amp/news/2-minnesota-classmates-die-years-apart-fighting-for-islamic-extremist-groups

edit: fixed  + links Dozens of students ~~and numerous teachers~~ started feeling bad, with some getting violently ill, all within the space of a few hours. The authorities showed up and quarantined the school and took a bunch of the sick ones to the hospital.  

There was never a diagnosis made. They never found anything like a virus or poison or bacterial infection or anything else that could explain the rapid onset of symptoms. Eventually, like weeks later, they gave up trying to find the cause and just said it was a case of sympathetic psychosomatic symptoms manifesting throughout the school.  

School was never so much fun. As an added bonus, free ambulance ride!  

edit: my feeble old mind was a bit fuzzy on some of the details, but I did manage to dig out an old newspaper clipping my parents had saved from the event, as was the style at the time.  

https://i.imgur.com/SVyQ9hZ.jpgOur football coach got suspended for putting his dick in a hotdog bun so that was pretty coolWhen I was in eighth grade, a seventh grade girl stabbed this guy in the foreign language area Not my high school but the town over:

A kid on the football team claimed to have been hazed by getting a broomstick shoved up his ass during “No Gay Thursday”, where anything that would normally be perceived as gay was not so. It made news all over the place. Coaches were fired, there was a huge investigation and everything. Eventually they found out the kid made it all up just to spite some of the people he accused.

Oh yeah also in MY high school, one of the teachers was arrested for being a pedophile, and our superintendent resigned after it was found out that he was cheating on his wife with another member of the school board. And one of our former baseball players called Mo’ne Davis a racial slur on Twitter. That got some news coverage too There was a kid in my middle school with anger issues that no one knew had anger issues. He went on a rampage and smashed all of our display cases with his BARE HANDS. Next day his fists were bandaged and he had to hold them over his head. He walked up to me and said, "Sorry dude I just lost control"All of the bathrooms got closed in seventh grade because a kid smeared poop on the stall of one bathroomHigh school: a boy's dead body was found in a rolled up wrestling mat in the school gym. The town spilt in half over whether or not it was a freak accident or foul play. This was almost five years ago, and it's still unresolved. A few peoples lives have been ruined from false accusations and the victim's family can't find peace or the answers they want. 

Edit:Dang this post got big! To answer a lot of the questions on here: 1.) I was senior at Lowndes High at the time and I'll never forget where I was when I found out (3rd block AP statistics), 2.) I'm not a detective, I just want the family to find peace and closure, and 3.) Yes I stayed here and just graduated from VSU, it's crazy seeing how many locals commented! One kid was part of the school show and there was a prop noose and for some reason he was messing with it and he hung himself.Some guy shoved a glue stick up his arse and punctured something. [removed]Over Christmas break of my sophmore year in high school our principal was pulled with over twice the legal BAC. Instead of being immediately taken to jail as he should have been, he was escorted home. Over the next week he was on almost every local news station and even got a minute or two segment on CNN. Needless to say, the faculty didn't think it was a laughing matter but the students found it hilarious and spent the remaining weeks of break having t shirts made saying things like "i partied with Dr. Syverson and lived."
Good times...Student was sleeping with a teacher.  Parents sent student to another school.  As soon as student turned 18, transferred back to our school.  Student and teacher eventually married and have kids...this was in the early 90s and I think they are still together.

Edit:  It wasn't Mary Kay Letourneau.  
Edit#2:  Also wasn't President Macron.  Male teacher, female student, Canadian school.  I think the student was around 15 when it started and the teacher was mid to late 20s.A couple of years after i finished high scool, a year 10 student came to school with a rifle, a list of names and a bag of molotovs... he ended up shooting himself in the head when the bell rang and kids came out of classes.

Here is the link to the coroner's findings.

edit: year 11 student, not 10.We had a girl who was an incident all on her own. She ODed on Oxy, then came back to school the next year to get held back, then threatened to shoot up the school on the day of that years talent show, then vandalized the school the day before graduation with another guy, and said guy wasn’t allowed to walk. She was thoughHigh school- one of the teachers was arrested for either having sex with a kid or taking dirty pictures of the kid. Can’t remember which. Big deal though since it was a super religious school. 

College- nothing major but a guy got arrested for masturbating in a classroom and getting caught on camera. Found out later I went to high school with himA few kids stole a propane tank and locked themselves in a garden shed to sniff the gas. Then one of them decided to light a cigarette, blowing the shed to smithereens. Fortunately nobody died, but some of them had to be hospitalised for a long time.Teacher in the middle of class gets a call, his whole family (wife, two daughters, and dog) all killed in a freak car accident. He returned a year later to teach but he was never the same, you could see it in his eyes. Heartbreaking. 
Went back to the school years later and he was still there, same great guy. Anyway hope you’re doing well teacher man! 2 things: A teacher sexually assaulted someone 20+ years ago, just came up a few years ago

A kid wanked in class, nutted on the floor and ate some of it


EDIT: he didn’t eat it off the floor, pretty sure some of it went onto his hand and he was licking it off

EDIT #2: just searched the teacher one up, he 'maintained a sexual relationship with a student' and 'had sex in the teacher's home on at least one occasion'. There was a meme going around our school for a while because he apparently put a note in the child's locker saying 'do you want to go for a splash?' or something similar (because he had a relationship with the kid from scuba diving and kayaking)We had multiple:
- one kid (year 10) set fire to the boys toilets because they stopped serving fish and chips on a friday in the canteen

- another kid (year 9) set up camp on top of one of the school buildings and threatened to jump (1 storey building)

- two people in my year (year 12) got caught fucking in the staff toilet ... the head of school waited outside the room till they finished 

- a group of year 9s set up a fight club disguised as a maths study group 

-my (Male)IT teacher was suspended for having a sexual relationship with a 14 year old boy from another school 
(https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/teesside-news/teacher-sexual-relations-boy-14-8319345.amp)
There are more but cba typing them all outA kid in my school beat up his mom, locked her in a closet, and tried to burn their house down with her inside and I think he got in a car chase.
Small towns, amirite.Hard to choose between:

-Senior on his way to his old town to visit his old friends for his 18th birthday died of an overdose after doing speedballs and his friends just kept driving and didn't realize he had died. I didn't even know what a speedball was.

-Somebody made a fake MySpace account of one of the teachers, complete with crude photoshopping of her face onto various porn scenes, then added most of the student body. Expelled.

-A guy accused a male teacher of sexual assault, the teacher ended up killing himself over fear of losing his job. He had no family and loved his job and his students so it was a pretty big blow for him. Never was proven to be a credible accusation.

EDIT TO ADD: The teacher was never arrested, or put on leave. The kid spread the rumor, another student if I recall correctly brought it up to the teacher that it was being said, the teacher left work that day and killed himself. School did a full investigation, nothing turned up conclusive.

My brother was in the same class as the student and teacher, so I am mostly going off what the kids in that class were saying. There was a physical improbability due to the lack of locks on the doors (kid said he was locked in), not to mention the teacher had taught for like 20 years or so and never had anyone ever say anything negative about him (before or after), was hugely beloved in the community and the kid was a known trouble-maker and all-around r/thathappened type of kid. Not saying it didn't happen and I never like to discredit rape or sexual assault victims, I'm just going off what was the general consensus of people closer to the situation.

Sad either way.Head football coach was murdered overnight by his son with an axe. The mom was also attacked but managed to survive.  We all found out at school the next day and went home early. The predatory media descended like jackals trying to get as many distraught students as possible on camera. 

The son is in jail for life.  The next coach built on the dead coaches vast improvements and won state three times over the next decade. Someone drew a swastika in shit on the wall of a bathroom. He was nicknamed "Shitler" 

It was a fun year. Someone spray painted "school is buns" on the clock tower. High school: My freshman year there was this huge fight and people started calling it a race war (Latinos vs blacks) and apparently churches were praying for us. There were helicopters everywhere and a bunch of cops patrolled the parking lot for a good week. 

College: Elliot Rodgers My freshman year, pretty early in the year, after being homeschooled in 8th grade, some kid hacked the school website and put on the calendar there was going to be a bombing, and then it went all over snapchat not to come to school that day. Anyways i was forced to go because our school has a system where if you miss 4 or less days you can exempt 3 exams if you have atleast all b's and i had missed 4 already. I guess my life is valued less then taking exams. My parents were assured nothing would happen, i came to school that day and saw about 20 cops on campus around the school, there was about 1/5 of the school there and even some teachers wernt there. There was one girl in first period who said she was gonna go to the bathroom and when she came back we looked at her like she was a fucking god. Anyways nothing happened but the kid got caught. Kinda anti climactic, but my school is kinda boring.Camr home from college and there were all these marquees saying goodbye. What happened was this kid was driving late one night, actively and of his own volition took a ton of pills and ran into a tree, killing himself. Everyone praised him like a hero, said it was just an accident, not realizing he OD'd, but the people closest to him knew what he did.Two players on the football team led a third player into the woods to buy drugs, had a pre-dug grave and killed him with a hammer and buried him. It was allegedly because the guy had raped one of their girlfriends but I think it came out later that she had lied because she got caught cheating.

One of the guys ended up turning himself in after the guilt got to him. It was pretty crazy though.

Edit to add a link since some people seem to think i made this up for karma (sorry if this link isn’t great I’m on mobile): https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/seattle-teen-sentenced-in-jasmer-slaying/Two interconnected incidents.  I'm old... so I was in high school at the time that Hong Kong transferred back to China.  If you had come to my high school 3 or 4 years before the transfer, you would have seen a maybe 5% Chinese student population.  But it jumped suddenly, like, up to about 50% in my junior year and stayed that way.  We had all these Chinese students, all from Hong Kong suddenly transfer to my high school, in a suburb of Toronto (nowhere near to Chinatown, by the way).  I'd say about half of those kids were there without their parents, living with other families... their parents were expected to come later, probably after the transfer back to China had been completed.  

For some reason, that I never fully understood, it was a known thing that these kids usually had cash on them.  Like, a _lot_ of cash.  I never really checked personally, but we used to talk about how they would have at least $1000 in their wallets every day.  

Anyway, the first incident was that a kid from another school came into our school one day and found the first Chinese student he saw and beat him with a pipe and stole his wallet.  The reason I think of this as "the incident" is that it was the reason our school suddenly started locking the doors, and you had to get in before a certain time otherwise you couldn't get into the school without buzzing in and the office knowing you were late, and we had security guards walking around all of a sudden.  Totally changed the atmosphere of the school.

The second incident happened the year after I graduated from high school.  I was back home for vacation and all our little suburbia was talking about was the principal of my high school being investigated for exploitation.  Apparently, she had been taking regular trips to Hong Kong, and somehow convincing parents there to pay her insane amounts of money and she would make sure their kids got in to her school -- which is such bullshit... i mean, I am assuming it works this way everywhere in Canada, but you just have to live in the neighborhood of a school and be of school age to get into a school, no one should be paying to go to a public school (beyond any regular taxes, anyway).  I'm honestly not entirely sure of what kind of lies she told these poor people, and I'm not sure if it had anything to do with why their kids were there without their parents and why they had so much cash on them all the time, but regardless -- she exploited a whole bunch of people.  And, in doing so changed the makeup of not only our school, but our entire suburb.  My 10th grade history teacher was in a porn movie when she was young. A student found it online, downloaded it and played it in class.Someone broke a mercury thermometer in the main hallway. Everyone was evacuated, all our shoes were confinscated, hazmat teams came to the school and we all just sat outside in the football stadium for hours. Untill bus pick up. (That's like 500pairs of shoes) most of us got them back the next dayI went to a high school in eastern South Dakota back in 2006, the incident involved the football team on a bus coming back from a game. A fellow female student was also present on the bus, and during the ride back some of the players convinced the girl to give a blowjob to the star player. She accepted, and was subsequently caught by members of the coaching staff. It leaked to the press and the media had a frenzy about it, the players were banned for a game or two and let off the hook following the suspension.Super weird story, but some random facebook account popped up, threatening to shoot up the school if this one girl didn't fess up for something she had done. No one knew who it was, and the girl allegedly had no idea what she was supposed to fess up about.

The threats continued, and the facebook account started posting naughty videos/pictures she had taken, censoring the nudity, but giving people an idea that he had intimate contact with the girl.

The school ended up going on Xmas break like 3 days early while the school district tried to figure how to move forward. There was a town hall meeting that a parent brought a gun to, which created quite a stir. Feds kept looking into it. Arrests were made, but each student was released on lack of evidence.

The facebook account progressed to basically taunting authorities that couldn't catch him. I think the height of it, my wife and I were at red robin one night, and the account posted that it heard the girl was at the mall across the street, and that a lot of people were about to die. From Red Robin, we watched the authorities converge onto the mall. The girl wasn't there, and neither was a guy with weapons of any sort.

The facebook account ceased activity at a certain point after an admission that he was some guy in Minnesota or something that just picked a random school, girl, and town to fuck with.

A few months ago, an arrest was finally made, and it was some dude in California. But man....it took forever for them to crack that case. [removed]The art teacher delivered a students baby in the library one day, girl didn't even know she was pregnant.There was this one kid who, i forget if it was during a class or not, started taking off all his clothes and then dived into the pool. A teacher saw him, got really mad, and started chasing him through the hallways (he got out of the pool once he realized a teacher was there). 

Guy slips, cuts his toe open, and continues to run through the hallways bleeding. Gets caught in the office, and he was suspended for like 2 days.

Some girl from down under attended my high school for a bit (US). She was failing an economics class, so she faked naughty texts between her and the teacher to get him in trouble, and the cops came to escort him out in the middle of class. Once it was found out she was faking, she got kicked out and was sent back to Australia to live family there. Crazy bitch tried to ruin a mans life cause she couldn't figure out basic economicsComputer teacher left his wife and kids to run off with a student... and his last name was HookerWeekly bomb threats for a while.
Fight in the cafeteria over french fries, one kid got a tooth punched out of his mouth, the other got tasered. 
Lots of heroin overdoses.
Gym teacher, who was also a cop, selling percocet to students.Several:

* Kid who was notoriously violent, aggressive, and quick to anger repeatedly slammed a girl's head into the back of a chair in chorus after she asked him to pick up a water bottle he had tossed on the floor. No one fucked with this kid. He was a short, pudgy redhead who looked completely unassuming, but anyone who knew better knew of his mercurial and explosive temper and his tendency to instantly resort to violence, and I heard through the grapevine that there was an official rule that he was not to be seated near known homophobic (he was openly gay) students or anyone else who was likely to antagonize him, as it was a question of when violence would erupt, not if. Dude was nice enough to me, but I gave him a wide berth, and that incident got him shipped off to a psych ward for the rest of his high school days.
* Some dude had some very personal secrets spread by someone who he thought was a friend. He confronted his "friend", things escalated, and the former friend got his head slammed through a glass door that was reinforced with metal wires. Long story short, there was so much blood that they had to cordon off an entire hall for WEEKS. This was slightly before my time, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's still part of school lore.
* It wasn't a huge incident, but it was widely known in my graduating class. One of the kids on the lacrosse team was pissed about an extremely narrow loss that was apparently due to a very contentious call by the referee, and when the team stopped at a Quizno's for a post-game meal, he smashed virtually everything in the men's room that he could and caused fairly substantial damage. The school got billed for the damage and while they couldn't officially pin it on him, everyone knew because he wouldn't stop bragging about it, which is also incidentally a pretty good summary of his character.I went to Southern Illinois University- Carbondale. In the 60's it got an honorable mention in Playboy as a party school. In 1998 there was a full scale riot on Halloween with businesses set on fire and cars flipped over. When I was there from 2003-7 I worked as a front desk assistant at one of the dorms. The night the White Sox won the World Series I was working and saw one of our RAs slide across the lobby in his socks and run outside. I don't care about sports and had no idea what was happening. The next thing I knew my boss' boss was telling me to shut the building down and only allow actual residents in. As the night unfolded I got reports that there was an impromptu parade of people making their way around campus knocking over lamp posts, setting trash cans on fire and eventually, trying to take down the goal posts on the football field. I will never understand the mental jump from "yay! My team won!" to "Let's set shit on fire!"Some kid used a dry ice bomb to blow up a toilet on the second floor during my freshman year.

A few months later, it happened again.Someone wasn't watching a special ed girl. She escaped the school and went missing for hours. We all went home 3 hours late and we had helicopters circling all around our school. They eventually found her dead at the bottom of a pond right next to our school.

Years later I became close with someone and he told me he was the one that was supposed to be watching her

edit: Yes, it was a student in the same grade as me (we were 8th graders) that was assigned to watch her

edit 2: I swear to god if one you punks finds out who I am I will delete this account

edit 3: Ya did it reddit. Someone figured out who I was. How how how how howA friend of mine who was dating this super popular girl got a 2015 Mustang GT for his birthday. Naturally, he took her out for a ride in it that night. He was going down a backroad when he lost control and wrecked it in a ditch. He broke his arm; she was in a coma for weeks and eventually died. The whole town had a eulogy on the football field one morning. Her brother who played for the Gators, Joey Ivie, tributed her on TV during one of the games. There's a big thing at Disney World called Grad Night, basically a senior trip that tons of high schools go to. Anyway, anyone that was there in 1999 or the years after knows about Northshore High from Slidell, LA. 

Some dudes were throwing a frisbee in the hallway of the Disney hotel, and it hit one of the sprinkler heads protruding from the ceiling. These kinds of fire systems are made so that once you've opened the valve, they're opened. There's no way to close it, it just keeps going. So they basically flooded and destroyed several floors of the Disney hotel during this big event. Lots of new rules in place at Grad Night after that...  

EDIT: Sorry guys, that was almost 20 years ago. I don't actually live in Slidell anymore.Someone got grass/weed killer and wrote in giant letters on our school’s oval “My Preist Sexes Me” with a huge dick. At lunch we used sit in the balls, until the grass grew back.At my high school we had exactly one death per year, up until my senior year. I don't remember who died in my freshmen year, but during sophomore year a kid died riding his skateboard holding onto the back of a car. My junior year a teacher hung herself in her classroom, leaving the students to find her in the morning. During my senior year we were all very anxious waiting for something to happen but luckily we all made it.A group of kids were illicitly selling nudes of their girlfriendsSomeone pooped in the bathroom and it was so big it couldn’t flush. People called it the Chipotle Burrito. Since apparently it was so big it looked like a Chipotle burrito. That was my senior year it happened. During our graduation ceremony the Chipotle Burrito got brought up during the valedictorian speech 🤦🏻‍♀️ Some kid in the year below me hanged himself with a belt from his bannister, and suddenly everyone was really close to him.My school was in Ontario, near the Québec border. A grade 12 guy lived in the middle of nowhere near the border, so one of the teachers, who lived on the Québec side, gave him rides to school. She stopped after he developed “unhealthy” feelings for her, and she asked that he be removed from her classroom. He kept writing her long love letters and stuff. He got her address from a phone book (common at the time), broke into her house when she was away for the weekend, and hung himself from an exposed pipe in her laundry room, leaving behind a letter explaining that she was entirely responsible for his death because she rejected his love. We had several. The first was a girl went to take her senior pictures with a tiger and ended up getting mauled. She ended up dying from the wounds, I think the tiger gauged her femoral artery. We live in a rural part of the midwest so the tiger thing was way out of left field. A few years later a Spanish class went to Costa Rica with the Spanish teacher for a senior trip and got caught up in an undertow. I don't remember how many didn't make it back to shore, but at least two students drowned and the teacher died trying to save one of them. We also had a bomb scare once, but it turned out to be a fake. For a rural school with only five hundred students, these events really took their toll on the place.A kid took a bunch of magic mushrooms and ran around the halls at lunch in his undies. A horde of campus security and coaches were chasing him until they cornered him on the bed of someone's truck. They were at a standoff and the kid was yelling, "come any closer and the briefs come off". A coach managed to sneak behind the kid from another parked truck and tackled him off.In 2012 my high school had their last prank day. All of the pranks were pretty tame tbh like BBQ sauce and mayonnaise on the stair railings and the ever common condoms like everywhere. The day continued as normal until about the afternoon when this senior took a massive dump and the principal stepped in it

It was legendary, but man did that guy get in some deep shit

And the senior got massive repercussions tooWhen I was a sophomore at all girls boarding school, someone had stolen my package from the school post office in a string of package thefts over the course of a week or so. My package was knitting supplies for a class that I needed to finish my final project. 

One day, I saw this notoriously weird girl knitting in the hallway. At first I actually thought it was cool she picked up knitting. But I realized they were the same needles and yarn I had ordered.

I went to her room and knocked on the door. The doors had fogged windows and old school latches without locks and it was typical to tap the latch and lean your head in to each others rooms. As I looked in, I saw another project with the other yarn I ordered! 

I came back later and she was there. I simply said, "Hey, look, I know you took my package. I really need it for class so if you give it back, I won't tell anyone you took it." She burst into tears and asked how dare I accuse her and that some friend sent her those knitting supplies. So I said I'd have to report her and left. 

During study hall that night, one of the dorm parents came to my room. She told me I was in trouble for accusing the girl of stealing and that I should be ashamed and apologize. I told her I was sure she had been responsible for stealing all the packages. I put together all my order info with photos and told them I saw her with all of it. 

The next day, we were called to an all school emergency assembly. The school dean announced that right then, while everyone was accounted for, they were doing "random" room searches. They searched her room first, and found EVERYTHING. I mean every single thing that people were missing for the two years she was there. She was hauled off to a locked room in the health center and sent away. The faculty had to pack her things and try to recover stolen items, by most of it got thrown out. She had a collection of dildos (stolen, idk). One of the most remarkable finds was the credit card of another girls dad that she lifted from his wallet over parents weekend. She even stole my Rueben sandwich from the hall fridge one time (still pisses me off).

She had a lot of compulsive disorders, apparently. Her roommate mysteriously left the school over thanksgiving break and no one ever heard from her again. I'm pretty sure we know why now. 

TLDR: all girls boarding school klepto stole my knitting supplies package from the PO, I got in trouble for accusing her, next day they did "random" searches and found every reported missing item from the last 2 years. They found a dad's credit card among dildos and Rueben sandwiches. AP got arrested for choking a ten year old boy at the skating rink during a children's birthday party over a piece of birthday cake. Then he tried to steal the kids wallet, kid didn't have one so AP took his glasses. AP got arrested for assaulting a minor.I have two, in middle school someone wanted to burn the place down, they started a fire in the men’s bathroom in the sink. A porcelain sink, in a tile enclosed bathroom...
I was walking back counselor meeting and saw the smoke, told my teacher we evacuated and he confessed in about 15 minutes. 

Second one involves getting finals canceled my junior year. They were cleaning out every old mercury thermometer from the school and someone dropped a box, code Red issued, full lock-down, hazmat comes in. Takes them two days to sanitize the area, those were supposed to be the first two days of the four day long finals. They told us anyone who wants to take a final is more than welcome, otherwise they are 100% optional. That was a start to a great summer...Some asshat student that everyone seemed to love was being a douchebag and illegally crossed a freeway, getting hit and killed by a grandpa driving a pickup truck. 

People tormented the grandpa and his grandchild who went to the school. I think the grandpa committed suicide and the basic attitude around the school was "I'm glad he killed himself." 

It was pretty fucked up to me. Back in the mid 90s I went to a small rural school. The administration decided we needed cameras in the building and outside. A group of about 5 teens put on masks and stole the outside cameras one weekend. They were found out about 2 weeks later when one started bragging about it.  They each got 1 week of suspension.


Also they stopped letting students use the library photocopier after one guy used it to make copies of dollar bills and emptied the coin machine.3 students gang raped a girl (not from the same school) with foreign objects and it was on tape. One of the guys dad was the Sheriff of a large county, although he couldn’t help his son, he ruined his career, I think he was corrupt or something, don’t remember. 

Same year a female teacher was caught having an affair with a female student.Someone called in a bomb threat, had to evacuate while cops patrolled the area on foot and helicopter, and bomb squad searched the school.

Another time, someone broke into the school and tried to steal money from the cafeteria's registers. They were empty and he was frustrated so he set fire to the cafeteria.

These incidents were after I graduated:

-We were the epicenter of a swine flu outbreak in my city

-school fired a teacher who was transitioning (mtf) made the news (was also one of my favorite teachers)

-priest/teacher sexually abused students for 10 years

High school was interesting. 
3 years ago, when I was in grade 9, Kid A was doing chin ups in the metal shop. There was a chair underneath the bar, and Kid B decided to put and hold a piece of 1/2" conduit sticking upwards on said chair during the chin ups. 

Kid A sat down, and the conduit went way up his ass hole, puncturing lots of important body parts. I do not know what happened after that. Apparently someone sued someone, but I don't know who was involved, like wether it was the school or Kid B.

Apparently Kid A almost died. 

A local school went on lockdown when a receptionist at a doctors office called police to report a student threatening to shoot up the school in his voicemail. What [she actually heard](http://www.easybakegunclub.com/news/3123/Fresh-Prince-Theme-Song-Causes-School-Lockdown-%28Pe.html) was the theme song from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.

https://www.upi.com/Archives/1993/02/02/Student-armed-with-shotgun-takes-over-school-office/1403728629200/

I remember my class getting into a frenzy about the amount of cops outside.  The school was fully surrounded.  Lots of wild speculation until another teacher came and whispered something to our teacher.  Who then ordered us into the corner - where we wouldn't be visible from the door.  After maybe 10 minutes some guys came in and escorted us down the stairs and to outside.  

Luckily his target, the vice principal, wasn't in that day.  

I knew him from boy scouts as well as school.  Was one of the scout leaders kids, even... After he got out of juvie I ended up at one of his parties, and he ended up shooting at a car that he felt had driven by too many times.  Everyone left instantly... No clue, or care, where he is now.  

oh, small tidbit - 
> 'There's been rumors since Friday,' said a 13-year-old student who did not want his name used.

was from my neighbor - where the guy had planned the whole thing.  I didn't know about it, but apparently the rest of my neighborhood did.  No one believed he'd actually go through with it, though.  My idiot neighbor told the news all of that, and was lucky enough that the reported changed his quote to not indicate him.  I only started this school this year (I just moved to another state) but last year they had three suicides and 70+ fights

Edit:Wow most upvoted comment I’ve gotten
I go to a HS in WV 
I know of the one suicide due to the guys step dad and his mom being my neighbors 
Not sure about the other two though.Normally I'd be glad that there's finally a thread I can contribute to, but not in this case. [See: Columbine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre)Kid killed a guy after waking up to unwanted fellatio while camping.

Was told not to talk about it and i didnt.A couple years ago a kid threatened to shoot up graduation, and told some people if they didn’t want to die to “wear red” so he knew who not to shoot. That shit got shut down real fast, so now people joke about it like, “Hey, you guys are alright - wear red tomorrow.” Kids broke in after hours, used bright red spray paint to write "dicks out for harambe" 30-40 feet in the air on the white paint of the cafeteria.These kids decided it would be cool to start vaping in the bathroom during classes. They used cotton candy vape pens that smelled awful (I never did them but witnessed several). One of the teachers who found out before they got disciplined said that they should “be like real men and smoke cigarettes”. He also no longer works at the school.EOD (bomb squad) got called when I was in 6th form. Someone found a shell casing in a teachers stockroom, didn't realise it wasn't dangerous. We were all at the pub when this EOD van goes whizzing by and pulls into our school.

Needless to say we had another pint before going back.Freshman year a while back my high school made national news for freak dancing. After that we had to sign dance contracts before events stating that we wouldn't do things like dancing at 90° angles. A local popular radio station named us the "Freakiest School in the Bay."The vice principle left her husband who also happened to be the art teacher of the same school for the math teacher. they all worked at the same school together. The principal was arrested for chasing his stripper girlfriend down the street, in his hummer, and shooting a pistol at her from his window. In the seventh grade I vividly remember walking into school one morning while a bunch of kids were leaving the building with tears in their eyes.  It was the 2nd week of high school, and when I walked into the hallways everyone was crying, students and teachers.  I walked up to the first person I saw and asked what happened, they said “Julio died”.  I had just met Julio for the first time the week before, on the lunch line.  I frantically searched for friends of mine to find out what happened to Julio, and finally met up with someone who had the story. 

Julio and a few new high school friends had met up after school to hang out.  They were playing around at an old junk yard, where there was a rope swing.  Julio had pretended to put the rope around his neck, joking around like a 12 year old boy. He slipped and accidentally hung himself.  One of his friends had tried to cut the rope with their teeth.  Those seventh graders who had just become friends watched him die.  The whole school was in shock, given the details and how tragic the whole thing was.  I didn’t go to class that day, just sat in the library with my friends and other classmates who couldn’t fathom what had happened.  I can still picture what Julio looked like, and I only knew him for a week.  He was a good kid. Late to the party, but a girl tried to help out another girl with suicidal tendencies, and ended up getting stabbed in the throat with a pencil. She made it luckily, but has a huge scar across her throat now. Wow my schools were boring as fuckTwo theater kids got caught having sex in the bathroom in the theater. They closed down the bathrooms there after that and only opened them up for a performance. It sucked because those bathrooms were so much nicer and cleaner, plus it was really quiet and peaceful.A girl got gang raped by her classmates in junior high.We had this thing at our school where every year at least 1 senior died of an accident. So when you became a senior it's like everybody was waiting for something to happen. Fortunately I was in the one lucky year. The year before 4 kids crashed and all of them died. 

We had the weird incident. A guy sneezed and slammed his head into a brick wall and gave himself a concussion. He was in the hospital for a good while. Better than someone dying to say the least.Someones grandpa (war veteran in a wheelchair) came to school when his grandson got into a fight.

The kid was kicked out and granps didnt see why was "kicking out" necesary.

He got into an argument with the "kick outer chief in command".z

Long story short, he shot and killed 2 people.

http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/19991006/novosti.htm

Here ya go.

Turns out he killed the kids dad and wounded mother and the kid himself.

This was in 1999


EditedKid at my high school got hit by a drunk driver and died. Suddenly, everyone at the school was this kid's friend just so they could soak up some attention from the tragedy.When I was in Primary School (For you no English that's 3 to 11 years old) there was an older kid, I say older but he was just 11. Anyway, he arranged a great escape. The school play ground linked to the teachers car park through a big ass field we wasn't allowed on. From the car park you could climb a gate to get out. So, on the day a break time the kid sounded a whistle (No joking) like a war horn and about 300 children sprinted across this field to freedom. Some kids just running for the hell of it, some following out noble leader like me. Teachers sprinted out, grabbing us and forming lines to stop us. About a dozen of us got through and made it to the car park, but a few teachers were there having cigarettes so they tried stopping us. I was caught meters from the gate and saw all but one child hop it. The older guy. He was chased by the history teacher but got back home and spent the rest of the day playing video games.

He's in jail for murder now.A kid was caught Masturbating and smoking weed in the bathroom, people called him 'The Weed Wacker'Not my schools but it's like a town over

Last year on an out of town football trip 4-5 of their football players were drinking lean and vodka and had a bag of funyuns, one of them decided it would be funny to A. eat them off of each other's dicks, and B send a video to the vice principal.... needless to say they got suspended, but funyuns are now banned from that school for some reason....

EDIT-for fun I'll add one from the great years of middle school

In the 7th grade there was a student we'll call joe. Now joe on top of being annoying and never shutting the fuck up in class, had um...digestive problems. He would routinely pass gas like a Gatling gun, and would also run out of class screaming holding his ass, presumably so he didn't shit himself. Once towards the middle of the year he passed gas so god aweful, it made our math teacher throw up. Then, a class or two later , he continued to pass gas like this causing a classroom to be shut down for an entire goddamn week. He promptly left the school and we never talked about that again.This one  just happened. Some kids broke into the principals office as a prank and he called the police on them to scare them. Also, a couple of years ago, some kids jumped off a local bridge. That's still the bar for mischief in my school Freshman year one of the IPC teachers had been fired for an inappropriate relationship with a student. This guy had been fired a district over in the next city for the same thing the previous school year...
-Same year we lost one of the varsity girls basketball coaches for having sexual relations with a student on the team. It later came out he and his wife were known swingers and she'd also participated in some acts with the same student (that last bit was here say from around school)
-A substitute teacher was also dismissed from the district after a pissed off girlfriend found out the sub was screwing her boyfriend, another well known student. He was 18 but still illegal. Ol girl stormed into the class while sub was giving a lecture and all hell broke loose, which of course is how admin found out
-Our star quarterback was on his way to practice when a chick from the "goth" group walked right out in front his car, as a bus was loading kids on the other side of the street. He thought he killed her but she actually committed suicide...
- Another coach from the Boys Varsity basketball team was also fired for sexually assaulting a student who was a manager for the team. She was in my class and he wasn't charged until the following year after we graduate
-French teacher and student didn't start off great at the beginning of the year, he went into the class one day and wrote all kinds of colorful words on the walls in black paint marker. The same year he convinced another kid to steal her keys out her purse one day when she left to use the bathroom. Drove her car around the parking lot a few times before crashing itNot school but class.

10th grade French class, had a guy knock on the door of our classroom to ask for one of the girls by name. 

The girl started getting up but apparently had a concerned look on her face and the teacher caught on. The teacher asked, “do you know this person?” Before she could respond the guy ran away and out of the school. 

Turns out that he had stopped another girl from our class in the hallway to ask what the first girl’s name was...A girl got raped in the computer lab and my school covered it up Becuase the male who did it was a really successful athlete.



Edit: also a kid that sat next to me (really quiet but not necessarily an introvert) posted on Snapchat saying he was going to shoot up the school the next day. People panicked, and a rumor saying that he would be targeting people wearing red (which was actually from a shooting threat the year prior.) Regardless, many people didn't show up the next day despite the fact that he admitted it was fake. He was dumb enough to show up the next day, the police were waiting for him and arrested him the moment he stepped on to school property. How do I know this? He fucking posted it on SnapchatIn my blended first, second, and third grade class,  there was a kid named Jake who genuinely believed he was a dog.  He'd sometimes pick things up from off the ground with his mouth when he was crawling around the room.  

There was one time when he picked up a staple from the ground and legit ate it.  

Not sure why everyone thought this was the coolest thing ever, but for the next 3 days,  like half the class started eating staples. 

It stopped eventually after lots of parent calls/ bad notes home.   A girl took the fall for her friend when they tried to shoplift and got caught. She didn't wanna go to juvie so she slit both wrists and when that didnt work used her studded belt to hang herself. Of course, this  happened in the school bathroom.

I happened to find her and got her down from the belt but was 14 and completely clueless as to what i should do with her wrists. Fortunately, she did it horizontally and they had already nearly stopped bleeding on their own. 

She spent months in the hospital, had brain damage according to the rumors, and it was a very crazy, crazy thing. She was a sweet girl i knew her a little but not well, but she was also rough around the edges and i think she even told a few people about her plans but no one took her seriously. It was a sad day for the whole school and we got sent home earlyWhile I was in high school, every year, someone committed suicide. So, that, I guess?This was the only article I could find on it: http://www.theskanner.com/news/northwest/6602-racially-tinged-confrontation-mars-knappa-de-la-salle-game-2010-02-04

Went to a really small, rural school with no diversity. Had a game against a predominantly black school. My classmates organized a 'white out' and all wore white shirts and instead of their usual chants they made up special ones including the phrase 'white power'. 

The students from the opposing team had to be escorted to the cafeteria and then to the bus out back to avoid fights in the parking lot with the racist parents. 

 One of the more eccentric seniors wore a gas mask to school on Valentine's Day because love was in the air. He was carrying his cello case and walking to school. Someone freaked out and called the cops.

His eccentric personality also made him clash with the cops. He was basically daring them to shoot him. Made local news. In the end his bright career as a cello player basically saved the day. Dude played a mean cello.

EDIT: Less interesting/memorable but, another time some local college dropouts bought a bunch of booze and weed and had a 24-hour party with a bunch of their local high school age friends (all their other adult friends went off to college without them I guess) at a house where the kids parents were out of town for the weekend. Someone set a mattress on fire, burned down the house.A teacher who worked for the school for over 30 years was one day pulled out of the classroom by police. Come to find out he was going through a bad divorce. The week prior he took a small amount of us down to Gettysburg and Washington D.C in a school trip for the seniors. While gone his wife, whom he had been taking care of due to an illness for a couple weeks, had suddenly got better. Cops had her video tape him when he would come over and he was poisoning her soup and drinks to keep her sick so he could take care of her. 

He was our chaperone for a full week, days before he got pulled out of school. When we were seniors, the freshman class had a huge "rainbow party." Rumors went rampant that several people had contracted herpes at the party, and a local radio station even ended up doing a story on it. Eventually, parents started frantically calling the school and the school had to send a letter home with everyone. The next year when I went to college and people asked where I went to high school, they would always respond with "Ahh, the herpe school." School trip to Russia in the early 90s. The Maths teacher beat up a taxi driver. All the kids ran riot, they stayed in a hotel that had one of the floors sealed off, which turned out to be a knocking shop. One of the students fell in love with a hooker, went mad and had to be drugged by a doctor to get him to the airport when they were leaving. Our school never did international trips again.

Edit: I just woke up to see this comment took off. Thanks for gold stranger. Little more Detail we were from Ireland, our Maths teacher was a black belt in taekwondo, taxi driver tried to scam him and then pulled a knife on him, two senior students joined in. Ages of students from 14 to 18. It was a complete shit show of a trip. 

A few people don’t believe this story, which is unfortunate. But it did happen I’m afraid. O’Connells CBS school Dublin Ireland 1992/3 We had a bunch, but the one that popped into my head first was a kid who brought pepper spray into school and decided to spray it. The whole floor had to evacuate because there was so much of it. They didn’t try and spray anyone with it, they just thought it would be cool to shoot a bunch into the air... Recently a student from my old high school videotaped a teacher snorting cocaine during their lunchbreak. Our drama teacher was fucking a student, girl was literally a weirdo that meowed at people and just was someone you’d feel uncomfortable about, the teacher was a freak, legit like rapist vibe.

He got parole and instantly went to her and they were gonna get married, so he got arrested again, it was a huge thing and the guy had to hide out cause a bunch of students saw it as an opportunity to jump the guy and shit, no clue what even happened to him at this point 

Article for those interested
http://www.thompsoncitizen.net/news/thompson/former-drama-teacher-facing-18-months-behind-bars-1.1372299Within 5 years we had two teachers convicted as paedophiles, with one of them having raped a disabled child and being sentenced to 18 years in prison.Late December, deer broke in. 3 of them jumped straight through glass, the first one breaking it and being cut and bleeding badly. Ran throughout the school, tracking blood, and some teachers were able to herd them out. Small school outside of Gettysburg, can be found in the gettysburg times from late December 2013. I was in the hall where it happened but I got to a classroom early and avoided them.

Edit: spellingOne of the teachers in my school got arrested in the middle of the school day during his fuckin class because he tried hiring a hitman to kill a teacher at another local high school. They both taught at the same school years prior and the other teacher must’ve really pissed him off.What a bunch of complete fucktards if you’re going to ram a van into the school don’t ducking tweet itI remember this happening my senior year of high school; and yes they were caught tweeting about itIt's like Harry Potter, but with terrible sex crimes every year instead of  magic adventures.There was an “unofficial” pact at my high school last year. Two guys died in two days. My cousin was supposed to be 3/7 but was unsuccessful, and luckily no one did it after she was found. It was really sad for all involved. The satisfaction might have made it worth it to her. "Worth it"Kind of funny tbh.I don't know how the FBI works, but if I was the agent who received that call I would politely tell that administration to fuck off, we have better shit to do than chase after pranksters. Schools are so insane nowadays, any little thing and every administration just flies off the handleThis happened at my school too, along with the bastard who smeared poop on the walls. What the hell is wrong with people?Why would the dads fight each other?Nothing was done about it but a guy i was friends with got a milk jug full of some milkshake or something and left it outside in 80 degree weather for over a month until the last day the seniors had, then threw it down a stairwell and it exploded everywhere. It could be smelled in all corners of the building.>they would prance around the halls

I'm imagining them just skipping around the halls for hours with their arms linkedat that point, he wasn’t dressed up like a ninja, he was a ninjaHOW THE FUCK DO YOU STAB SOMEONE WITH A MACHETE?!?!?? It would be like poking them with a chisel...

"Ow!"  
"Sorry, dude. Let me try again."  
"Ow!"Paul gingerich?UK? When was this?We had a similar incident. A girl who was I think about 17 iirc, had an older boyfriend who was out of High School. 

She was found hanging from a ceiling fan in a motel. There had been 2 other recent suicides in the class just below us that year, and she apparently had a rough life so it was labeled suicide. 

A year or two later I found out the boyfriend’s guilt got the better of him and he confessed to killing her because she told him she was pregnant while they were doing Special K and in his altered state it was all he could think to do. 
Similar thing happened at my school. Making zeppelins and the teacher sprayed ethanol from one of those squirt bottles onto the already burning flame. The zeppelin flared up and two girls caught on fire, one's skirt and another's hair. First girl did the stop-drop-and-roll (remarkably effective), while the second girl ran screaming to the bathroom. Both got pretty serious burns and hair girl had to wear this special sleeve on her arm for the next 5 years or so. Needless to say, that teacher didn't return the next year. I saw this one in the news! Less obscene, but at my very Christian private school, there was this girl a couple years under me that got voted "Prettiest Eyes" or some bullshit like that for the yearbook. No one noticed that when she got her picture taken with they guy who won, she crossed her arms and flipped off the camera. It wasn't until the last day of school when the yearbooks were handed out that people noticed. Except for me. I was on the yearbook committee, I was in charge of those pages, and I had noticed when putting things together. I intentionally left it there cuz she pulled it off well and no one else noticed. She did it smooth, so fuck it, she earned that bird in the book. Still have it around here somewhere.

Edit: for those asking for the pic, I will try to find it in the next couple days. If I get lucky, what sub should I post it on so you'll be more likely to see it? Or should I just post the link here as an additional edit?More PG but one kid in my 8th grade class flipped off the camera during class photos. It made the final cut.Fuck that noise.  I would be livid.  Like turning green and morphing muscles livid.  Those music programs and barely funded and those kids worked their asses off selling shit to family to earn it.  It's like the training class of future Younique sales reps.Damn. Now I want to watch that one again. Were you a student during filming?It's a bad sign when a documentary about heroin addiction comes to your schoolSounds wrong but you should be grateful he was that dumbWhat a complete dumb shit, can't even rampage right.We had a guy who didn't want to be there, but his father (career Navy) wouldn't let him come home. So he took the 50-foot header onto concrete way out. I wonder if B feels like shit A few other students and I passed out from the chemicals they use during dissections. I didn't really fully pass out, I just felt awful in my entire body, asked to go to the washroom, then got super light headed in the hallway and slumped myself against the lockers. A teacher walked by and between the fact that I was leaning on the lockers and that according to her that my face was literally green, she figured out something was wrong and got another teacher and they limped me to the elevator then to the office where I eventually got picked up and brought home. I missed a test because of that and my teacher didn't believe my story until she heard from the other teachers that kids had been passing out in a certain science class (my science class) so she asked if I was one of them and they told her how my face was green which is kinda hard to fake so she gave me an extension.  

Edit: it wasn't even during a dissection, the chemicals just lingered in the room for a few days.Art teacher: *walks into girls bathroom to retrieve said camera*

Chris Hanson: “you wanna explain what it is you came here for?”I don't get why people even think that racing a train is an even remotely good idea. Its like hundreds of thousands of tons of metal and cargo that doesn't stop.My aunt died that way, they ruled it a suicide Same thing happened to a kid from my class in elementary school. He was called to the office and didn’t come back. Turned out he collapsed at the office door. Everyone thought he was hit by the door, but he had an aneurysm. His twin sister was in our class. Just tragic.That's pretty sad. CPR in real life (unlike TV and movies) usually doesn't work but I'm glad they tried. And here's another fun fact: an AED only activates if it detects an abnormal heart rhythm. If the heart has totally stopped, the device won't even try to start it.

Edit: when I said CPR "usually doesn't work", I meant that although it may save lives, at best only 10-20% who get it ever recover well enough to leave the hospital. Here's a [good article on the topic](https://mobile.nytimes.com/blogs/well/2014/07/17/the-cpr-we-dont-see-on-tv/?referer=)I like the shrug at the end "what can ya do?"that sounds awesome and I am jealous we never had a dog break inBig up YorkshireWe have drug dogs that check our school every once on a while, his owner(?) accidentally released him from his job. The German Shepard ran around the school 3 times getting pats and scratches from everyone before he was put back on duty. He was a good boySusan Reinert iirc?To be fair, if he wanted to blow up the school because fuck that building and everything it stands for, but did NOT want to kill anyone, it's not a bad bet.So like some sort of... fight club?>Also, a few kids tried to join isis.

Yeah because thats the less interesting one.Haha, sex, yep that's- 

Oh. Oh. Not good.In 6th grade someone puked in the hall. There happened to be a bunch of people who were apparently sympathetic pukers nearby, because it started a chain reaction of like six people puking in that hall.School is buns, man. He knew what was up.Is that between the kidneys?

We had to start going to the bathroom in pairs. Smearing poop can be an indication that a child is being abused. There's a lot of reasons actually.

EDIT: People are asking for more information on this, so I'll throw a few links up.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16511365

http://www.dummies.com/relationships/sex/warning-signs-of-sexual-abuse-in-children/

http://www.minddisorders.com/Del-Fi/Encopresis.html

 EDIT 2: Some people are getting upset so, In regards to the first link; I'm aware that it makes it sound like there's no correlation initially, but it goes on to suggest that stress and other factors are a potential. If being abused *doesn't* cause stress, I don't know what does. I'm a redditor, not a doctor people. I have lots and lots of experience in the mental health industry and would love to raise awareness of problems, but I can't exactly write you an essay of my own. Also, literally the second sentence I wrote was, "There's a lot of reasons actually." 

Now, from the first link:
 
> Reported soiling rates were 10.3% (abuse), 10.5% (psychiatric), and 2% (normative), respectively. The soiling rate in the abused group differed significantly from that of the normative group, but not from the psychiatric group.

That seems to suggest that abused children have an 8.3% increase in this behavior over a normal child's rate. So yes, it could just be stress. Or it could be an age factor. Hell, it could just be boredom. However this is not a very normal behavior and at 7th grade and should be considered as a potential for other factors first IMO. Finding the kid, getting really pissed off at them when they potentially have some serious problems is only going to make things worse. People here are saying that this is common. I never saw nor personally heard of someone smearing poopIf it's the one I'm thinking of it hit the news pretty hard. That one is so odd, I've tried to decide for myself what might have happened, but I still can't figure it out.

Edit: [adding this]( https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/45div4/kendrick_johnsons_death_is_not_an_unresolved/) in by request of /u/myneighbertoltoroYeah, that made national news. It's an incredibly strange case.That's terrifyingSurely it wasn't a prop noose then, right? I feel like an actual prop noose should be designed to snap if it held the weight of a human..I bet it healed instantly.jfc..what was the reason?
Man, school sure is bunsIt was like when tiger woods got pulled over and the internet memed the fuck out of him.Yeah!! He got moved to my charter school, we had a blast pretending to chug from bottles behind his back.Does this student happen to be the current president of France?"I'm going to kill everyone in this school... starting with me!" They banned him from walking? That's terrible.Why is it that neither of those surprise me?The shed blowing up and the kids staying alive reminds of a Looney Tunes scenario.

EDIT: It's "Tunes", not "Toons".They obviously missed chemistry class.that boy ain’t right"I heard you can get high by huffing gas... I guess propane counts."My worst nightmare as a husband, father, and dog owner. Aw man. I just wanna hug the man right now.I came here to laugh at stupid teenagers not bawl my eyes out We had one like this. I had the jerkiest driver's ed teacher and was talking to my mom about it and she asked his name and as soon as she heard it she lit up and went "OH John Doe? He was so much fun!" and started telling me what a great teacher he was which shocked me because he was such a hardass. Which is when she explained that a few years after she took driver's ed his son died in a really horrible car accident.

So then it all made sense.Gotta get that protein 

Edit: Great, now my most liked comment is about someone eating his own semen off of the floor.

Happy Holidays!These all sound tremendously British haha, a throwback to my secondary school days> The head of school waited outside the room till they finished"a group of year 9s set up a fight club disguised as a maths study group" is the most nostalgic thing I've ever read I think.

I miss home all of a sudden This sounds familiar to me. Did this take place in the Albany NY area?The turd Reich I wonder if he invaded PoolandOur school's rival spray painted "[our school name] is overeated." on the hill right in front of the building.

Yes, over-eated.

It became a running joke afterwards.WhyDidn't that guy post on reddit, or am I thinking of someone else? What a strange policy...Shit are you from like White Marsh? Same thing happened to this kid last year. Had a bunch of bears and lights up all last year in the tree clearing where he hit.I think I know the girlfriend of the football player. Is this Pacific Northwest around 2004

Edit: i see my comment was vague can be misinterpreted. The girlfriend I knew was of the accomplice, not the one who cheated. Far out, that's intense.  
    
A similar thing happened in New South Wales about a decade ago. One of the muderers was the nephew of a very high profile Australian serial killer. This kid just idolised his uncle, so him and a mate took another mate out in to the same forest the uncle used for bodies and killed him with a sledge hammer. No motive - these two kids just wanted to know what it was like to murder someone and I guess, were better friends with each other than they were with the third friend.That is so fucked up in many levels that I'm fucking done with this thread. For fucks sake poor kid. Hey ummm can you just go into the woods to buy drugs? 

Damn HS is really a weird time...One of the supervisors at my high school was a cheer leader for the buffalo bills back in the day. Someone got a picture of her in her outfit at a game and showed everyone. Ms. P was coolWow, a few months ago I broke a mercury thermometer on myself on the sofaLol go Rough RidersThe Plainfield incident?If he was a rando who picked up a girl, how come he had her nudes? Or was it actually someone who did know her?If you look at the bottom of the website, they also have a Minecraft server.

That’s some serious dedication.[removed]That's a fuckin' dank meme page tho
thanks for showing me that website lolThat site is unreal.there is a tv show "I didn't know I was pregnant" lolHow do you not notice you're getting significantly bigger for 9 months?The marginal benefit didn't outweigh the marginal costshe went to way more work to fake texts and some elaborate scheme instead of just studying. high school econ is not that hard!Wire glass is no joke. I saw a kid punch through a door like that. Bad idea. Kid at my school pissed off the lacrosse team and they tried to shove a parking cone up his ass.Our valedictorian was the local pyro. He made bombs at home and either blew them up in the desert or gave them to the guys that worked at the movie theater. They would blow up mailboxes all over town. He accidentally burned his truck down on one of the desert trips with about $300 of school funds inside (he was on the student council).

I looked him up on facebook a while later and he was *jacked*. I had to figure out why and doing a little digging revealed that he had done time because in college he got drunk, shot a few holes into his frat house walls and when confronted he pointed it at the guy. When the police came he had about half a dozen guns and thousands of rounds of ammo in his room.Putting a student in charge of a special ed kid is asking for trouble. People have jobs specifically to work with and watch them I'm sorry, but you becoming close with someone implies they're your age, right?  Like, you were both students?  Had they assigned a child to watch over a girl with special needs?Man, I thought this was gonna end in a kind of funny way like they found her at the local DQ trying to order a cake or something but this is just tragic. So there's no switch or anything to turn if off?

Seems like bad design to meYeah that's this little ol' thing called distribution and possession of child pornography... Heard about a school that traded pics like Pokemon cardsI know people get sad that students die. But when one does, everyone is suddenly friends with him or knew himI imagine this guy had a bucket on his head that fell off during the chase, only to reveal a second bucket. Adrian Peterson?We had our photocopier banned too, after a guy put his schlong in it and sent it to every single printer in the school, resulting in about 10,000 lovely penis portraits. Administration tried to destroy as many as they could but understandably a few escaped capture. Word on the street, is original copies of said "portraits" are collectors items at the school these days.I get really dizzy if my blood sugar drops and had a football after school.

The cafeteria was closed and I didn't have anything. So I snuck in and took some chocolate milk and left some change to cover it.

My coach yelled at me for leaving change, saying I was better off just stealing it.That sounds like a prison.I was just going to post the same.

I was a Freshman during the shootings. I was outside the commons (cafeteria) with a buddy when it happened. A few guys came out and said there was a "guy with a gun", but I assumed it was probably a senior watergun prank or maybe some disturbed dude angry at his girlfriend. Then I heard what sounded like shotguns or pipebombs. I dashed across the street in the middle of traffic to the elementary school field.

I didn't think it was a big deal at the time until I went to my buddy's place shortly after. But when I saw it was on CNN and President Clinton was about to make an announcement...I was floored.

The rest of the day I was trying to make wind of it, couldn't go online because I was bombarded with Instant Messages and E-mails on AOL for days (my profile had Littleton/Columbine in it). I knew two people who died. Didn't know the gunmen except in passing when they would walk around the hallways in military fatigues/trenchcoats.

But yeah, that's my story.Told not to talk about it by who? Don't let your memes be dreams.Some kids? Everyone and their grandma vapes in the bathrooms at my school.> EOD (bomb squad) got called when I was in 6th form.

They should be lucky they never saw you in your final form.By shell casing you mean an empty gold-colored part of the round, right? Like a harmless tube of brass?Ugh, when I was in 1st grade, a 3rd grader (or some other older grade) was playing unsupervised on the playground equipment in the fall and tripped or fell somehow. His scarf got caught and he got hung right there on the playground and died. I remember no on was allowed to wear scarves on the playground after that. I know if I ever have to care for kids I'll be extra careful about it.probably why they chose to have sex in that bathroom > Two theater kids got caught having sex in the bathroom in the theater.

And this is unusual?That escalated quickly> Long story short

that is not an appropriate use of "long story short."So there was a WWI veteran who thought he was better artist than he really was and long story short the United States dropped 2 nuclear bombs on Japan and the German government killed about 11 million people.Similar thing happened at my high school. When we were seniors a classmate of ours committed suicide and tons of the "popular" group used his funeral as an excuse to skip school even though they had been horrible to him. They didn't go to the funeral, just said they did. Really despicable and I hope they feel ashamed looking back at it. >He's in jail for murder now.

not for longEven though I’m sure it was just a bunch of small children running aimlessly getting yelled at it sounds glorious.That escalated quicklyThat's the gayest thing I've ever heardy thoHow is that Funyuns' fault?Bro job! Bro job! Choo-choo!

I bet that was a fantasy of some gay kid on the team, he got drunk enough to say "hey everybody we should do this!" and everyone else was drunk enough to think it was some kind of joke and went along with it.Student: Jake ate my homework!Wait, that actually happened somewhere? Can you find an article? I've never heard of that actually happening.This should be a moviesounds like the Skins episode where they take the field trip to RussiaWas one of the students nick named “The Machine?”In (recently) Soviet Russia, culture assimilates you.Do you know The Machine?I love auto correct when I’m trying to curse Early 2015?But why?Yeah this one beats pissing in the heating system by a mile.I think it was mostly the family forcing the administration, but the whole reasoning was that it was still theft and "appearing to be going over state lines" that's my understanding of it....this happened every couple of years that someone stole it. 

Funny thing was they installed cameras pointed directly at it after the second time and they still don't know who did it.The next picture should have had the FBI in the background. To answer the age old question of whos dad could beat up whoelse's dad.Something about not getting answers about the gas made for anger and arguments. IdkThis included him piggy-backing her around, it was like how an actual junior high couple would act.Clearly wasn't a good ninja if he got caughtIt was probably a big knife but the media probably called it a machete to sound scarier.That's the one!

That's not gonna end well. I did this in primary school when I was maybe 7 or 8, except I only poked my tongue out... they didn't notice til we got our class photos back, the cunts made my mum pay for everyone to have their photos reprinted with my face photoshopped... they took the lower half of another girls face and put it over mine, and also chucked another girls ponytail on my head for some reason. had to spend a couple days in the principals office too, I continued to be a brat and just kept lying saying "I was licking my lips!! I'd never do such a cheeky I swears!!!" . Can confirm, school didnt fund shit for the band program. All of our band events was fundraised by the 150 or so band students.Probably one of the addicts.Fucking tell me about it. Lost several friends to it. 

Don't do heroin, kids.[deleted]My partner while dissecting a frog started gagging and ran out of class. When she came back the only thing left was the jaw that we had to cut open. She did it with her arms straight out while freaking out. Broke the jaw and stabbed into the stomach or something, which splashed fluids everywhere including my open mouth because I was attempting to tell her to be more careful. I ended up in the bathroom sick from that and she cut her finger. 

Good times, good times. Art teacher: came to get some toilet paper none left in the boys toilets 

Chris Hanson: understandable have a nice dayTeenagers tend to believe they're immortal. Too often they're proved wrong. Also it really fucks with the drivers. My dad "killed" two people doing this. College students trying to make to back by curfew and didn't want to wait five minutes for his train to pass by. Again it really really fucks with people to take a life like that. A heart will keep beating even if the brain has been compromised, the nerve impulses are generated in the heart not the brain. So yeah, it wouldn't have really helped in this situation because there was nothing wrong with his heart but the students wouldn't have realised what was wrong.Start a dog break in. Follow your dreamsYep. The principal was Jay C Smith. The book gave me serious pause as a kid. I can’t image how my teachers felt returning to work every day.

FTFY

Or a snickersPrevent extreme blood loss :)We called him the poopatrater.You mean "The butt-ler!"I think the suspected person's parents did opioids, heroin, and painkillers, or something like that.I work as a treatment advisor in a BRS facility that houses foster kids and at risk youth. We see this behavior a lot from kids who have suffered abuse and neglect. There's a lot of reasons a kid might feel the need to smear poop, it can be an act of frustration, as in a 'fuck you' to whatever establishment they are performing the act in, or it could just be some sort of gross fascination with feces. But to me I think it comes down to attention seeking. People tend to view child abuse as strictly within the confines of physical harm or sexual assault, but in actuality neglect can fuck kids up just as much. Like being locked in rooms for days at a time with no access to the outside world, and yes, a restroom. It's actually not surprising that a kid might resort to playing with his own excrement out of pure boredom, and boom, a recurring behavior is born. Also the sight and smell of poop on the walls is enough to grab the attention of even the shittiest neglectful parents, so that in itself, in the child's eyes, validates the behavior. Truth is, there's a lot reasons people might smear poop, some really are just doing it to be funny or going for shock factor, but sadly it's also very likely that it is a behavior picked up in childhood due to neglect and abuse.It's an infamous sign of child abuse. It's rare on an individual level, but... cases become quite well known.Hey man, please give [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/45div4/kendrick_johnsons_death_is_not_an_unresolved) a read, and possibly edit it into your comment if you agree with it. It contains a very thorough write up of the event and calls out a lot of lies that were spread at the time about his death. 

I don't usually ask people to edit their comments but you've got a lot of misinformed people responding to you by spreading crazy conspiracy theories that are disrespectful to his memory, so I thought this would be the most efficient way.   Yeah, I instantly knew the one OP was talking about. What a crazy incident...I could easily see it being an accident, "Haha guys roll me I'm sushi!" and then they leave him there as a joke and he suffocates [those gym mats are pretty heavy]. They panic and dont report it.  
  
Meanwhile, I dont know why that's where you would hide a body, unless an argument escalated and the kid died somehow and you panicked? But I'm assuming they didnt find fingerprints or dna on the body or maybe there was too much of it to be conclusive and the person got lucky...  
I just cant see it being purposeful.Yup. The school kept it on the down low and it happened a few years before I got there so we didn’t know a lot about it, but my friend knew the guy who was standing next to the kid when he accidentally hung himself. That’s how we know it wasn’t intentional.It might have had a harness he didn't use so it could have technically been a prop.According to multiple news sources, “thrill”.Prosecutors called Sorenson's slaying a "thrill killing." They alleged that Orlewicz was excited by the prospect of killing someone and getting away with it.

Orlewicz, of Canton, Michigan, took the stand and admitted that he killed Sorenson, 26, but insisted that it was in self-defense. He admitted stabbing Sorenson 13 times after an extortion plan went awry and Sorenson threatened his life.

"There was not a murder," Orlewicz testified.

On November 7, Orlewicz said, he, Alexander Letkemann and Sorenson arrived at his grandfather's house in Canton, Michigan, with the intent of robbing Adam Duwe, who had just inherited $40,000. But Orlewicz said he felt "icky" about the plan and was going to pretend Duwe couldn't make it. That's when Sorenson's temper flared, Orlewicz testified.

Orlewicz said Sorenson took out a gun and threatened to kill him.

"You think this is a game?" Orlewicz recalled Sorenson screaming. "I'm going to drop you to your knees and blow your frigging brains out."

Orlewicz said Sorenson began waiving the gun around, so he grabbed a knife from a tool bench and stabbed him from behind.

As the two fought, Orlewicz said, the gun dropped from Sorenson's hand. Sorenson scrambled to find the gun, Orlewicz said, and the two continued to struggle. "I kept trying to stab him and get leverage in the fight," Orlewicz said. "I was stabbing him in the back."

During his testimony Orlewicz also admitted that after Sorenson died, he used a hacksaw to decapitate him. Orlewicz said he threw Sorenson's torso into a field and set it on fire. The defendant said he took a blowtorch to Sorenson's hands to cover up fingerprints.

Orlewicz told the jury he feared that Sorenson was tied to the Mafia and that his family would come after him.

He said his actions after the death were all out of panic.

Orlewicz corroborated Letkemann's testimony that Letkemann stood by and did nothing as Orlewicz stabbed Sorenson.

Letkemann, 18, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder April 1. He will face 20 to 30 years in prison in exchange for his testimony against Orlewicz.

Orlewicz denied Letkemann's assertions that after the killing, he played with Sorenson's head like a puppet.

"That's someone else's imagination," he said."

You don't fuck with a Brit's fish & chipsA real gentleman I tell ya Yeah, I thought this sounded like the PorcosWe had “Hawks Have CLASS” displayed on our cafeteria and it was either our senior class or rival school (I never found out) that threw paint over the C and the L. Cause school is buns I read that he did. He's the one that posted the retribution video on YouTube and wrote a manifesto. I remember seeing his video got posted on r/cringe the day before the shooting. I didn't see the post before the shooting though, kinda felt like it could have been prevented.But not unheard of at private schools.  Mine had a similar one where if you got all "A"s in a class you didn't have to take the final.No im from the other side of the bay, easton area. Maryland, right?

Edit: spellingYup, Seattle.Reminds me of the scene in Breaking Bad where Walt sets up a drug deal at a car wrecker... And the experienced drug dealers were like "what are all the malls closed?"[deleted]Yes!! You live near here? I think he hacked her icloud account.

The cherry on top.My first ex's sister didn't know she was pregnant until she felt the kick. She was six months along. She'd already been hella overweight so an extra 15-20 pounds apparently was nothing. 

This is probably what triggered my tokophobia.Some people don't get much bigger during pregnancyDude TLC has an entire show dedicated to it. Very educational. If you ever want to see a dramatic reenactment of a woman birthing a baby into a toilet thinking it's just a really bad poo, I highly recommend it.You've obviously never seen the amazing show, "I Didn't Even Know I Was Pregnant," which tell the true stories of women carrying babies to full term without ever getting a clue that they're pregnant UNTIL THE BABIES START COMING OUT. And some of these ladies are fully grown, educated women who've already had other children and are fully familiar with the experience of being pregnant! 

They answer every objection you can think of: Many of the moms didn't gain any weight. The baby never stirred. The moms never stopped getting their periods ... And on and on. It's AMAZING. The one I saw showed a mom who was home alone with her ten year old son when she went into labor. She literally thought she was dying. She even hid herself away in her bedroom so her son wouldn't have to watch her die. Only when she reached down and felt a hairy head coming out of her did she finally figure it out. And then she had to call her son into the bedroom to help her deliver the baby. 

At the end of that episode, they showed the son holding his little sister, while the mom talked about how guilty she felt for having to force her son to deal with all that. (But he seemed totally fine.)

About the only reality show I have any use for, every episode is a gem. If only she had understood economics.I never saw the actual incident or any pictures (if they even existed), but it was my understanding that it looked like the scene of a murder. I think the district actually had to hire a professional cleaning company, but don't quote me on that.yea but think of the savings of not hiring expensive staff! Very much so. I have high functioning Asperger Syndrome and you would not believe what actual aids have to go through in trying to make sure everything runs smoothly with other kids with bigger needs. Giving that responsibility to a student is a huge no-no, like in this case.Yep. It's an entire class where you pretty much watch the special needs kids.Apparently not, I guess that's just how they are designed. All of the sprinkler heads are kind of like one-time-use valves. Once they break open, they just keep on rolling until the water main is shut off, but still, all the water in the system has to go somewhere.Most old sprinkler systems are just pipes full of water, they have a material that melts easily blocking up the sprinkler heads. As a bonus they rarely drain the pipes out so it's usually stagnant water that has been sitting in the pipes for years, not the clean clear water that you see in movies


Edit: This reminds me of a funny story, awhile ago in high school my friends and I had this great idea to drop bouncy balls off the second floor of our school onto the first floor. We started with a couple at a time but as the weeks went by we added to our collection, usually getting 25 cent ones from the machines in a restaurant we passed on our way to school. Eventually toward the end of the year we dropped a bucket of them over the side and one of them bounced up and hit a sprinkler head and broke it resulting in it pouring water all over the place. The janitor caught us in the act so we ended getting our parents called and had to help clean up. When I got home my dad was outside fixing up our neighbor's car and he told me that "accidents happen but sometimes even if they are accidents you still get punished because that was irresponsible behavior". He told me to get him his pair of jumper cables out of the garage, then he told me I was grounded for a week from video games and I had to do the dishes and used the jumper cables to jumpstart our neighbor's car. This happened last week at my school. It was sad but I never talked to him. But suddenly my entire school was his best friend. It’s upsetting.

Edit: for anyone wondering, this took place in Ohio.While a lot of it I'm sure is people looking for attention, I really don't think it all is. When I was a junior a popular guy at my school killed himself in a pretty violent way. I never talked to him or had classes with him, but had been around him and was close with some of his close friends. It was the closest I had ever been to death, and I was still pretty far removed from it. I never talked to anyone about it but I really struggled for months. It messed me up pretty bad. I had nightmares about his death and really just had a hard time processing it.

I think at that age things like that cause most people to be confronted with their own mortality for the first time. They're all just trying to process it. My school brought in counselors, but it wasn't like someone like me could use up that resource when he had plenty of friends who did need to see someone.r/2healthbars

Luckily, they didn't close off the balcony and I was still able to enjoy naps there during my free period.  He was in a wheelchair. He can’t use the escalators.

Edit: my most upvoted comment is also the worst joke I’ve ever made. Also, I didn’t mean to upset anyone, just a stupid throw away remark. Did OP just *yada yada yada* someone got shot?It's downright disgusting. I knew the guy and even used to be classroom 'friends' with him, but still didn't attend his funeral because it wasn't my place. That was for family and close friends, not someone who just sat next to him in Science class.

Holy fuck! What a piece of shit.This is a christian minecraft server no swearing pleaseI think a lot of kids who go to military schools are on kind of a rocket sled into a military career courtesy of Dad. They're never given a chance to find themselves or make their own decision - they just defer to the authority. 

Then they get to the Academy and realize they hate it and the idea of four years of this hell or a career in more of the same is just a bleak purgatory. But they're afraid to quit because Daddy (even if Dad never told them they couldn't come home), so there's one way left. :-/ 

When I was raising my kids, even though I saw certain talents in them, I worked hard to ensure that my school and career guidance was just that - guidance, and that they had to make up their own minds. 

Let me tell you - when your kid is an exceptional artist, it's REALLY hard not to push her into an art program. As someone who joined the military very young but got out very quick I can tell you why. As a young man I was looking for approval from my dad. He was a lifelong military guy and i figured the only way to make him proud was to follow that. I was not mentally ready for the military and got sent home in a less than healthy mood. Luckily my dad told me that I didn't need to join the military to make him proud and that he was sorry if that's the environment he created. I think I got lucky but I totally understand why some people feel trapped. They're doing something that's stressful and that they don't necessarily enjoy and if they leave they feel like they'll be a disappointment.

I don't know. With the evidence I have presented before me, 100% of bodies hidden there never have their case resolved.It was a gym bullying thing.  We called it "pigs in a blanket" and I'm sure different places had different names for it.  Basically the weaker kids were rolled up in the mats or just pushed in a corner and then covered with the mats.  Since the kid couldn't seen what was happening, everyone in the gym got free hits without the victim being able to see who was doin it.  

It started off as pretty harmless with people just slapping the mats.  It didn't exactly start off as bullying either since everyone could be ambushed and rolled up.  Everyone got their turn in the mats and it was all in good fun.

But predictably it became more violent and people started fighting back leaving only the small kids as victims.  Instead of slaps on the mat people started just punching and kicking the mats.  People ended up grouping up both to protect themselves and attack others in numbers.  It all ended for us when a kid broke free just as another kid went for a flying kick, and ended up hitting the escaping kid in the face.  The coach wasn't even that mad and had the attitude that was closer to "well you idiots ruined it now, this is why we can't have nice things."  

I could easily see one of these situations ending in death.  Being in the mats was terrifying and chaotic even as you're laughing your ass off.  If a kid has a asthma attack or a panic attack, there's no way for anyone to know while you're wrapped up because everyone is screaming.  Sometimes when I'm looking for a thrill I use 3 scoops of coffee instead of just 2. I mean nothing says self defense like multiple stab wounds, beheading the corpse, and burning the body with a blow torchEh same thing"Stop laughing - you're next!" First one to the diploma graduates, the other gets held back.Yep.

Yup. Southside. Used to work in Avon though. I'm glad they caught the bastard. And I'm glad the girl seems to be ok. What an absolute lunaticAlso seems to me they could have gotten him on child pornography for the mere possession of it.There were people in the town that legit thought that, but it would make sense that in all the authority's investigation of her to figure out what she had done or why the guy was so obsessed, they would've figured out that it was her, if that was the case.I haven't seen the show but I've heard a lot of the people on there are pretty overweight/obese. Not surprising to be honest I've been overweight, close to obese at one point and you kinda get used to feeling shitty. So a new shitty feeling caused by pregnancy might just fit right in. cool anecdote, my great grandmother was a nurse in WW2 and this woman walks in saying she has appendicitis, turns out she was going to give birth and everyone was amazed because she did not look it at all.I'm definitely one of those weird ones, I'm fairly tall with a long torso and people did not realize I was pregnant until I was about a week away from having my daughter.

sad shit to see when you are 14 :/Chris Hanson: why don't I take a seatNoDefinitely not. The poor kid was toast.  Before my sis was a doctor she worked at an eye bank, and she sometimes saw cases like this. It might be cold comfort to the kid’s family, but a brain aneurysm in a high school student is pretty much an ideal scenario for organ donation. My sister would wait in line behind all the other surgeons harvesting heart, kidneys, liver etc. When the donor was basically hollow,  she could get in to  remove the corneas last, because they’re the least time-sensitive.

A good portion of the slim ones just ignore or write off the obvious signs. There are some pretty insane cases like this. Apparently there's a female boxer (MMA?) out there who's one of them.

Because one round house and that baby is special needs.Tonight, you party with us. The Unapooper.Once in a motel in Las Vegas as a kid, I was messing about on the bed, which was positioned next to the wall, but with a small gap of a foot or so. I rolled myself up in the blanket and then fell down the gap between bed and wall. I was totally trapped with my arms tightly bound by my sides, in a hot room without AC. My dad and brother were present and helped me out - If I were alone I'd probably have died there in one of the stupidest and most uncomfortable ways imaginable*Explosion heard in the distance*He’s the type of villain to get the movie a rotten percentage on rotten tomatoes being labeled “bland villain” She was fighting then. She gave birth after a match when she went to a doctor because she was pissing blood, irrc. jesus - i'm not even claustrophobic but that strikes me as a horrible way to goThat's how my uncle died. He was a paraplegic and somehow he ended up trapped between the bed and the wall and couldn't get himself out and help didn't come in time. My mom didn't know what the oil change light on the dashboard was. She went to her friend (who did a popular morning talk show in Montreal) and asked "why is there a gravy boat light on my dash?" The next morning the entire city knew she'd said that. Those little green swords at Starbucks. I had no clue what they were used for until I was complaining one day that my coffee gets all over the lid when I walk. My friend grabbed one and stuck it in the top of the lid and asked why I didn't use a stopper. *a stopper* omg my life has just changed...Not me but my dad. 

He always likes to look nice and put together. One day before church (I was maybe 14), I asked him if he had a lint roller. He got it for me, and it was absolutely covered in lint. So I ripped off the top sheet. Dad's eyes widened in shock. "I always thought lint rollers were so expensive for how few times you could use them!" He never knew there were more sheets underneath.

Dad was in his mid fifties then. He hates when I tell that story. Not sure if this is a feature on all smoke detectors, but finally after five years of owning my house and getting used to grabbing a chair and knocking the batteries out of it, I just hit the test button on the front when it went off while cooking. "Hush mode activated". It turns it off for fifteen minutes and automatically turns itself back on. It felt like unlocking a secret character in mortal kombat.That the approximately correct amount of loose leaf tea for one cup is..... a teaspoonful. When I was in first grade, our teacher had these really cool cookie jars. One was a dog that made barking sounds when you opened it, one was a cat that meowed, etc. We all loved those cookie jars.

I realized literally yesterday that they make sound so the adults know when someone's getting into the cookie jar... It's fucking genius.When I realized that the division sign '÷' is an empty fractionWhen I was a little kid (maybe 3 years old), I found a little plastic container of candy in my mom's purse, and I ate them all. My mom discovered this and started panicking and screaming. Apparently I'd eaten an entire month's worth of birth control pills.

She called Poison Control, and they told her I'd be fine, though my hair might grow slowly for a while. It's been 30 years, and I'm still bald, dammit!For years I have had this electrical outlet on my back porch that is really intermittent, damn thing works about half the time, then stops working for a couple of weeks. Frustrating. About six years after I bought the house, I also figured out what that one switch in the living room does.......You know the plastic hooks on vacuum cleaners that are used to wind the cord around. Well the top hook will spin 180degrees to release the cord, so you don't have to spend time unwinding. Didn't realize this till my wife showed me well into my 30's.Went into a store and purchased a nice suit for work but forgot to bring the coupon I was going to use. I asked about it while checking out and the girl told me she's sorry but can't help me.
       She then placed the same coupon on the counter and asked if I had dropped it. I must have been distracted because I denied that it was mine 3 times before I finally understood she was trying to be nice and give me a coupon. Felt really dumb.Clapperboards in movies. They're used as a visual reference to sync the audio and the video together in editing.Have you guys seen those escalators with the green lights shining through the steps? When I was very young. Maybe 5 or 6 years old. I asked my dad what those lights were for. He told me they were for the blind. 

A few years ago maybe when I was about 23 or 24. I got on one of those escalators with lights again with a friend of mine. I wanted to tell my friend this little fact that my dad told me years ago about the lights in the escalators. But as soon as I wanted to explain I realized my dad was trolling me the whole time. It took me just under 20 years to realize it.It took me four years of owning a car to realise I could spray washer fluid onto the rear windshield. 

I just assumed it only sprayed the front and I would just occasionally throw a bucket of water on the back if I needed to. Then one day I just noticed an odd symbol on a lever I hadn't seen before. 

Held that mother down for about 10 seconds before a massive gush of liquid burst out the back and changed my life for the better.I bought a used pickup truck in the late 90's that had an electronic key fob like any car these days.  It had a couple other buttons as well that when pressed did nothing.  I asked about it at the dealership and they told me it was probably for a remote start that wasn't hooked up.  After two years of driving that truck around in cold Chicago winters, I sold the truck to my brother when I bought my first new car.  One day while talking to him he started the car up with the remote starter.  I stared in complete shock as he explained that you have to hold the button down.Not me, but my dad. He gave me his truck for my 16th birthday and when we went to go gas it up, I put the gas cap on the little hook thing on the gas door ([this](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/hondacrx/imageproxy.php?url=http://i107.photobucket.com/albums/m305/rob89m3/DIY/fuellid2.jpg))

He stopped mid sentence and goes "I've been driving this truck for 20 goddamn years, and I had no idea that's what it's for."I was a housekeeper for someone years back when I was in the college (side job, extra money). 

I would see short straws in the random places at the house where I worked. I usually just picked them up and threw it in the trash can. It took me two years to realize the person I worked for had drug addiction and he used the straws to snort the drugs... 

Now look back, I am glad I wear gloves for cleaning other people’s houses... I had no idea that salad spinners were to dry your salad.  I thought they were to mix your salad dressing or some shit.  

We got one as a wedding gift, so I loaded one up, dumped some dressing in, and spun a ton of the dressing off of the salad.  This made me think the product was to apply dressing flavor to all of your salad bits, without dealing with all the calories that can come from overloading on dressing.  So naturally I thought it was a total waste of time and money, and tossed it into a cabinet never to be used again.

A year goes by, and I see a comment on Reddit about salad spinners and how they are such a game changer and so worth it, and I thought people were just batshit insane.  

Nope.  I'm the idiot here.  They're to dry your washed salad bits so you have nice, crisp, not-soggy salad.  I had no idea, and the box sure as hell didn't tell me that.  I worked with a guy on a construction site, and it took him 7 months to realize that the porta pottys had urinals in them. He thought that bowl in there was for a sink that they put in the nicer ones.

EDIT:  I've had a hundred people respond to me saying that they have used the urinal as a sink, or didn't know what it was for.   [Here is a picture of what a urinal in a porta potty looks like]( https://imgur.com/snT3N0W). God help you if you've put your hands in there. The Bagel button on toasters only toast one side of bread, buns, bagels etc.Just today at the Gym: I forgot my shower sandals, and I was like, "oh sweet, they have disposable slippers, just in case such an event." Put them on, walked through the change room, used them. They worked well..... I just realized they were showercaps.....After high school, I was working a temp job in a business remodel.  The wood floors had been put in and the contractor had a big roll of paper that he taped down to cover the floor to prevent scuffs and a scrapes while the work continued.  One time I touched the roll of paper and noted that it was somewhat sturdier than normal paper and reminded me of craft paper that we used in elementary school.  I remembered that as a child,, the teacher always called it (*doink -- moment of realization*)  **construction paper**.When I was a kid, I had a large toybox with a lid. I had to use my head to prop up the lid when I grabbed things. There was a place to put a stick to prop it open.

I noticed there was a stick kept in the kitchen for me & my brother's spankings. By the time I realized the stick was originally meant for the toybox, I had outgrown the toybox.The wiggly metal bracket on the end of a tape measure is like that on purpose. The amount it wiggles matches its thickness. So you can take inside measurements (and push it in) or outside measurements (and pull it out) and you'll get consistent measurements.I lived in the US for a year (I am European) and I was really annoyed about our light switches. They didn't lead to any lamps. There were no lamps in the ceiling at all and I couldn't figure out why we had switches on the wall. I was also super annoyed that a few sockets (outlets?) worked sometimes, but not all the time. I never talked to our landlord because frankly, he scared me, and since I was moving back soon I just figured I'd live with it. 

Fast forward 11 months when I visited a friends house. I couldn't turn on her big floor lamp. "Just do like this" she said and flipped the light switch on the wall. It turns out, in America, light switches can lead to sockets in the wall. For years I thought those weird storage pod thingies some cars and vans have on top of the roof were mini canoes. As in I kinda thought that until I was like 24 but I was too nervous to ask anyone. Since as long as I can remember my mom has kept this creepy doll hung up on the wall in our garage, right next to the door to go in the house. The thing’s a real eye sore, clothes are ugly and it’s just this raggedy thing. So recently, I asked my mom why the hell she keeps this ugly demon doll hung up on the wall and she says, “Really? It holds plastic bags.” And walks up to it and pulls a plastic grocery bag out of its ass. 19 years in that house and I always thought my mom just had weird taste in decoration.

Edit- fixed some Apple I’sThe Kensington Lock hole on my first MacBook. I spent forever Googling things like “tiny pill shaped port” until eventually I asked my dad what it was. He took the Mac downstairs, got out this cable and locked the Mac to a radiator in the living room.

“Go do your homework and I’ll give you the key.”That I did not need to put eggs in the refrigerator egg holder one by one.  Instead, I could put it on top of the eggs in the case and simply flip it over.That dryer sheets prevent static cling. I always assumed you put them in to make your clothes smell better. So when I moved out I just never bought any. Then one day I had to do laundry at my mom's house. In the middle of switching laundry I'm bitching about the socks all stuck to the blanket and my mom says, "Well then put in a dryer sheet dumb ass!" Oh. So that's what those are for. Those travel toothbrushes...

I always carried one on me and always wondered why they made one so tiny. Until one day on vacation with my gf I'm using it and she says "why don't you use it normally?" She then grabs the casing for the toothbrush and attaches it to the bottom of the brush...

Mindblownwater towers are not for storing water. they are to "pressurize a water supply system for the distribution of potable water". not sure why i thought they were for storing a bunch of water in the skyI always wondered why there was a 'g' in the stylized Disney logo, and it honestly took me like 15 years to figure out it was a D the whole time and I was just an idiot. "Condensed Soup".

I always wondered why the cans were smaller yet tasted super salty and were thick.  I never took the time to read the instructions about how you're supposed to add water.

I went 39 years without knowing.  One day  I finally asked my wife and after she stopped laughing, she explained it to me.I don’t like any type of seafood. I just learned last week that hush puppies aren’t essentially fish stick balls, but are fried corn meal. I think my parents preyed on the fact that I don’t like seafood, and used that as an excuse to not share their hush puppies. So I was a first-year medical student and was late to class and ran in sweating through my oxford shirt and khakis.  The lecturer was some esteemed local windbag cardiologist.  

As I sat down, he stated very grandly, "THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE STETHOSCOPE IS THE PART BETWEEN THE EAR PIECES!"

I took my stethoscope out and started looking at the little spring thing that connected the two earpieces together trying to figure out why that cheap little part was so important.  After WAY longer than it should have, it occurred to me that he was talking about the doctor's brain and dropped my stethoscope like it was hot and hoped no one saw me examining the little spring thing.My uncle decided to start driving a moped around instead of his car when I️ was about 6. It dawned on me years later that the decision wasn’t exactly voluntary. Little notches on the side of my bed liner in my tacoma. Apparently if you put a 2x4 in those you can actually load 4x8 sheets without them sitting all funny on your wheel wells. Took me way way to long to figure that one out.September 11th 2001. Days before my tenth birthday. I remember watching the footage and seeing scenes of ground zero shortly after the dust settled. There was a sound echoing around the buildings I thought it was a broken PA system or something...

Nearly 16 years later I joined a volunteer fire department and heard a [pass alarm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3nThzsNHZU#t=35s) go into full alert... Instantly reminded me of that footage. It was the same sound...

The [sound in those videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM4CMtsdNjY) was not a broken PA system. It was downed firefighters...

It took most of my life to realize they weren't just a shitty palm-ruining design.Growing up, my mother raised me to never look into her purse because it was rude to rifle through another's belongings. At 7 years old, I felt like a rebel and looked through her purse while she was out gardening. I found her lipstick, wallet, and an odd shaped canister that looked like perfume. I figured lets give it a shot and sprayed some all over me (mostly my face). What i didn't realize was that it was pepper spray. 
I ran around screaming 😱 in utter pain. Lesson learned...Took me an embarrassingly long time to realize that “movie” is referring to a “moving” picture.  Old-fashioned term similar to “talkie”Crash investigation sites on the highway.  I'd see the signs for them and think to myself "that sure seems like overkill to have an ongoing investigation into a crash for all this time."  My wife pointed out to me that they are bump-outs for pulling off the highway to inspect damage from minor accidents, and she made fun of me for being an idiot.When i was a kid,  my grandfather and i built a model 1989 Batmobile together. We worked so hard to get it together. Neither of us having built models before it took hours. We finished up,  and we had one green piece left.  We looked through the instructions,  looked all over the model. Could NOT figure it out. Finally i went a got my grandma to see if she could figure it out. She came in, took one look at it and

It was the top of the super glue. We had forgotten to re cap the super glue

My grandfather died a few years ago...i STILL get shit for that moment 25 years later. 

Good memoriesThe time I mouthed a douchebag... 

So I was about 8 years old and had hurt myself in some fashion that I cant remember. So, being the good latchkey kid that I was, I marched myself through my parents bedroom and into their bathroom where all the bandages/antibiotic/etc were stored. I proceeded to bandage myself up and when I was putting everything back I noticed something interesting in the back on a higher shelf (kids are nosy fuckers). So I pulled it out to look at it and found a cool balloon. I thought at first that it might be a hot water bottle but it wasnt red or flat, it was blue and floppy like an ice bottle but the opening was MUCH too narrow to be an ice bottle. It also had a really cool spray nozzle type thingy attached to the end. I didnt know what it was for! 

So I tried to blow it up... Like with my mouth... Like a balloon. It didnt work. 

I put my mothers douche bag in my fucking mouth... 

I realized it when I was thinking about that medicine cabinet and I was 22... Over a decade after it happened. This is the first time I have told this story... Fuck, I need to go find some listerine. Joggers have sweatbands on their wrists to wipe sweat from their forehead.

Edit: Yes, athletes use them to keep their hands drier, but runners primarily need to keep sweat from running (ha!) into their eyesThe metal square thing on a stapler can be turned around so the prongs of the staple go outwards instead of inwards 

EDIT: thanks for gold <3That a ladies pad sticks to the underwear, not the ...  my wife still won’t let me forget that. I was at an ante-natal class with my wife when the instructor shared a  tip for making sure you let your baby feed from each breast an equal amount - by taking it in turns, left/right, which one you start off with. How do you remember which you started with? You use a hair tie. A few minutes later, she remarked, "and don't forget to put the hair tie on your other wrist when you next do a feed."

To which I remarked, rather too audibly for a room of 20 strangers, "oooohh, you put it on your *wrist*!"

Oops. I was a bit slow that day. And many other days.That the pockets on suit coats/blazers, etc. and back pockets of slacks are (loosely) stitched closed and meant to be cut open. I spent a solid four years of my life as a pissed off pragmatist- "why the fuck would you put pockets just for show? Those assholes"

One day, a friend heard my incessant bitching and goes, "you know you just make a small snip and pull the thread out- then the pockets are accessible."


Goes to closet, snips open pockets... "well fuck me."

I am 43 years old, I only learned about 6 months ago that “this little piggy went to market” does not mean he went shopping for groceries.I had just bought my first house and needed to patch a hole in a bathroom fan exhaust duct in the attic. I was walking around Lowes thinking, "I wonder what sort of tape I should use for ducts?" Then it hit me. Duct tape. For ducts. Now if anyone sees this, all of the comments below will be about how it's not actually good for ducts, should use the silver stuff, etc, but I definitely had that moment that day.It turns out almost all backpacks I’ve ever owned included an emergency whistle! I only figured it out last year, it’s on a plastic clip and [looks like this. ](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/OyWDOgc) 

Edit: I am now learning more than I ever wanted to know about which backpacks have this feature.  It's pretty ubiquitous on outdoors-y backpacks, but your child's backpack is less likely to have one because no one wants to deal with a playground of elementary school kids with whistles.When I was a kid, we stayed in a guest house that had a *dumb waiter* - something I'd never heard of before.

I thought my parents were insulting the staff when they said that "breakfast was arriving by means of a dumb waiter" until I saw it in operation for myself.Pipe cleaners. When I was a kid they were used for crafts and stuff and I just figured that they were used to clean, like, kitchen pipes. In my kid brain that kinda made sense. As I grew up I just never thought about it again really.

Then one day in college I decide cigars are expensive and pipe tobacco seems much cheaper overall, plus the rustic feel of a man on his porch reading with a tobacco pipe always appealed to me for some reason. So I went out and bought a cheap tobacco pipe and while I was checking out the cashier asked me if I wanted pipe cleaners...the scales just dropped from my eyes. It took 20+ years to learn that pipe cleaners were used to clean, you know, pipes.

Edit: glad to share the experience of enlightenment with you fine folkPotato peelers have a little indentation on the end of them. It’s used to scoop out the black parts of potatoes that you don’t want to eat.My mind alternates in this thread from "I didn't know that and it's really cool" to "How the fuck did someone not know that?!"In the song "I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus", it's daddy dressed as Santa Claus.

I'm British, we don't call them Q-tips and I didn't know what they were until I was in my mid twenties and saw a meme with a photo of a Q-tip. I was genuinely shocked.

People never actually use them in books/films, they just say stuff like "I think you need a Q-tip" if someone misunderstands something.

I  thought it was like saying "Get a clue" and I'd always just assumed Q-tips were a reference to some kind of American game show, like the something for $100 thing, which we also don't watch in the UK.


Grapes on the front of raisin packages.  My girlfriend told me last year that raisins and grapes are the samething and I laughed it off because that's nonsense.

Then I saw the big grape on my raisin box.

I did not know there was a trap door at the bottom of it.  I showed an ivy league alumnus friend of mine and their mind was blown.

Edit: shitty Latinmy boyfriend until about two years ago (he was 21 when I had  explain this to him) but, he asked me to have dinner at his parents house and I asked what we were having and he said, "roast beast." and i laughed at him making a "grinch" joke, and then he asked me what I was talking about. I mentioned that he called the roast beef, "roast beast" and that "the grinch" reference was funny.

and I realized he seriously had no idea what I was talking about. so, I had reveal to my boyfriend that "roast beast" is not an actual thing. it's called roast beef, and "roast beast" was strictly a Dr. Seuss reference. 

he was a little embarrassed.
but, it was really, actually so adorable.The fact pineapples do not grow on trees. They're just.plants. 
I didn't know this until I was hanging out with my friend and we were swimming in her pool. I got out and pointed to, what looked like to me, a weird spiky-looking plant and she looked at me completely dumbfounded. She just looked at me and said in a disappointed voice, "That's a pineapple..." I felt like my whole life at this point was just a lie. For the longest time, I genuinely thought pineapples grew on trees.

Edit: I'm well aware trees are plants. I just worded it weirdly cause I didn't know how else to write it.That the reason baby vests have envelope shoulders is so that when they do a shit that explodes all over the vest, you can remove the vest downwards instead of lifting it over their head and smearing shit all over their head.

*Edit* Jesus Christ okay I get it, they're not called vests in America. Onesies, people!When you first walk into a Home Depot there’s always a stack of orange buckets by the entrance, and for the longest time I thought they were HD’s equivalent of a shopping basket.  I’d haul that thing around just throwing screws and hardware into it, and then just put it next to the cash register when I was done. They’d always ask if I wanted the bucket too, and I just thought it was a clever way of selling more buckets.  Only about a month ago did I realize they’re just buckets, and everyone at HD just thought I was mentally imbalanced.

I got my drivers licence while only using the clutch pedal for driving in reverse. Didn't even know you had to use your accelerator until my girlfriend pointed it out after having my licence for over a year.This is by far the most educational thread I've ever seen on reddit.When I was little, I was fascinated by TV guides. I thought shows on television were just aired totally at random; I used to stare at the TV guides and whisper, "How do they KNOW??"

Edit: I feel this is a little off-topic, but I guess I'm saying I never knew what TV guides were for--I mean I knew they somehow divined the future, but I didn't have any clue what they really were. 

I hope it counts. 

I hope you have a little chuckle at child-me. A bit of a tangent, but I listened to Don McLean’s American Pie for 30 years before I realised “this’ll be the day that I die” was referring to Buddy Holly’s “that’ll be the day that I die”.In Minneapolis there's a liquor store called G. Will Liquors.

So I have earbud headphones and where the cord splits there was this slider thing, the whole time I thought it was some thing to adjust the length or something.  Then I found myself untangling my headphones and I said to myself if these 2 ends didn't split up things wouldn't be so bad... then it hit me, that sliding thing was there to keep the ends together and it stops it from tangling.The logo on the ps2 can be turned so you can stand your ps2 or lay it flat.

I drove a small mid 2000s sedan as my first car, and it was low enough to the ground that cars headlights behind me ALWAYS shined directly in to my mirror and hence, eyes.

He would have been around 15 at this time. We were at an amusement park in line to get lunch.. My mother turns to him and asks what he wants.

He pauses for a second then says "I want a cheeseburger with no cheese". At this point I do what any older brother does start to laugh a little bit and ask him the question again. Same response.. at this point he knows he's doing something stupid.. So I ask him you mean a hamburger.. he says "I don't want ham".Just had one of these moments yesterday - my buddy was loading groceries into his trunk and I was trying to position the milk so it wouldn't roll around.

Edit: 1st Gold! Thank YouAs a toddler I always loved it, in church, when we’d sing about some bear named “Gladly” and who happened to be crosseyed. Every time it painted a cute little picture in my child-mind.  A cuddly teddy bear with crossed eyes and a sweet smile.

Edit: Use t=93 link as suggested by /u/tectoo .From the age of 11 until 24 (am 30 now) I used my teeth to pry the plastic cover off of new deodorant sticks. Was doing the morning routine with my husband one day and he opened a new deodorant stick BY TURNING THE BOTTOM TO GET THE PLASTIC COVER OFF. I was in hysterics for a bit. It never occurred to me to do it that way, even though you TURN THE BOTTOM TO GET MORE DEODORANT OUT. Those little brown stirrers for coffee, the ones with holes in them like straws.

For the longest time I thought they *were* meant to be used as straws. Lots of scorched tongue moments as i sucked piping hot coffee through them.

I still am not clear on why they have the holes or whether they're fully intended to be stirrers.

EDIT: Got my answer 30 times over. No need to tell me what a stirrer is anymore. Thank you.The numbers in Minesweeper help you figure out where the mines are. I thought it was a game of chance until well into college.

Needless to say, I never won it.I had a teacher ask me if she could buy me some toys in exchange for not running for some student council type position in like a really young grade (1st or 2nd). She asked me after holding me back from recess, and I ended up getting some cool stuff, so what the hell did I care? I secretly thought that she just wanted the other girl running to win, because she was really well-liked and top of her class type of kid and I was a really odd nerdy kid with no sense of shame or embarrassment. 

That was my opinion of the whole thing probably up until my mid 20s, when reflecting upon the situation... she was probably trying to save me from my weirdo self, and didn't want the other kids to have more opportunities to make fun of me.I was a working professional before I realized that the Windows key on the keyboard brings up the start menu. Mind blown. I'm late for the party, but I just have to share this one. I was about 14 years old at the time, me and my parents had been on a holiday and was waiting at the airport to board our flight. Suddenly I noticed one "Thomas Cook" being called to gate 14. Then gate 6. Then gate 21. And so on... I started looking around for what I assumed was a very stressed out guy trying to figure out where his plane was leaving from. And I remember thinking "no wonder they keep calling his name when they keep on switching the gates". It wasnt until we were on our flight that I saw a Thomas Cook airplane drive by, and silently went "ooooh...."

edit: I should probably mention that we were at an spanish airport, so all I could understand was Thomas Cook, gate and what I assumed was a numberIt's disheartening that I'm reading this like it's some kind of LPT megathread.Up until a few years ago a good friend of mine was confused as to why they call it Fingerskating if you're mainly on your toes.Sub Reddit- thought I could just post to the main page.

When I was in my 20s I never understood why bars would have an 80’s night. I mean I understood the idea was to have a themed music night, but why were 80’s nights so common and not for instance a 70’s or 60’s night?

A couple weekends ago I was at a club and they were doing 90’s night and I was telling my friends, “this is great I love all this music! But what happened to 80’s night?!”

Then I realized they do these nights to pull in the older demographics. The 80’s night crowd doesn’t go out anymore because they’re too old for that scene. Now, bars are doing 90’s night because my generation is on the older end of the going out crowd. Fuck.The fuckin square at the opposite end of the McFlurry spoon is to put on the mixing machine to stir it up."You can't have your cake and eat it", always seemed such a daft phrase. What's the point of having cake and not eating it? I realised way too late in my adult years that once I have eaten my cake I do not have it any more.Yesterday I realized that ham is pork. I am 33 years old. I was at the grocery store and they had a picture of a pig silhouette. His butt was labelled "Ham" and I have always claimed to not eat pork but loved ham.

That scarves are actually really useful for warmth. I kid you not.    

I grew up in the American south, and I always saw scarves on like Christmas cards or in little picture books and cartoons. I thought they were just an accessory, no matter the season. A cute way to make you feel the holiday spirit.    

Moved north; discovered SCARVES. When I was little I remember every time my mom took me to a sit down restaurant and the waiter or waitress would ask me if I wanted a super salad. I was like: "Yea! A super salad sounds good!" 

It sounded so cool when I was a kid. It took me years to realize that they were really asking if I wanted a soup or salad with entree. I can only imagine what these people thought of this kid running around this restaurant screaming SUPER SALAD!!!When an old building had EST in the cornerstone I thought it meant estimated.    Like EST 1678.   Like it was too old and they just had to estimate when it was built.

I saw one with the EST 1985 and I was like "dude they should've known for sure when that building was built."

A buddy of mine set me straight that it was "established."

I was about 25.Those plungers with the wooden handle and pink suction cup. I always thought it was just for toilets but fuck me, I guess they were for the SINK. I mean, you can use them to unclog a toilet but they're terrible at it. My mind was blown when I found that out...

Edit: Grammar.How to tie my shoes. Buckle up, there's levels to this.

**Part I**  
My wife always used to double knot her shoelaces. I'd watch her pick them apart to get her shoes off and I asked her why she does that. "I don't know, they always come undone."

One day I noticed that when she pulls the bows of her knot, they lie up and down her foot, not across it. A few minutes' playing around and I realized—it matters which way you make your knots. If the granny knot underneath goes the opposite direction from the way you pull your bows, you're actually tying a *square knot* with bows, not a *double knot* with bows. A square knot is a non-binding knot, so your shoelaces will come untied very easily.

[The remedy is simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAFcV7zuUDA#t=15s), if your shoelaces come undone look and see which way your bows naturally lie, if they're going along your foot instead of across it, undo your knot and tie the granny knot the opposite way you normally do, then continue as usual. The bows will lie across your foot, and the knot will stay until you pull it out.

To see why, take some rope and tie a simple double knot, just one granny on top of the other, and tighten it. It won't come out easily (seriously, do this with string you can just throw away). Now do it again, but reverse the direction of one of the knots and you have a square knot—see how easily it falls apart.

**Part II**  
If you run, your running shoes have a feature called heel lock that you're probably not using.

Did you ever wonder what those eyelets are for that head around your ankle? The ones you never put your shoelaces through because they're too high up? Those are for using [heel lock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IijQyX_YCKA#t=20s).

**Part III**  
You're in this now, you've come this far, so you have to leave with some next level shoe tying, the [Ian knot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O-xaJrao1w).All intensive purposes. My whole life, I never understood this phrase until I finally read it some where... All intents and purposes. Ah, I'm a dummy. The hole in a spaghetti spoon is to measure out a noodle portion.  Poke through just enough noodles to fill the hole and multiple by the number of servings.  Naturally don't try this with macaroni or you'll have some pretty crappy serving sizes.

I see two versions of this playing in my mind.  In the first, you are standing on the chair, taking the thing down and knocking out the batteries.

In the second, you are swinging the chair at your smoke detector as hard as you can.I made it all the way to here with my smugness intact and this one broke my smug cloud. My god.

While we were waiting for it to do its thing, I admitted how I'd bricked it, and that I wasn't using the original cable because I'd misplaced it years ago. As I was about to leave, he walked around the corner for a moment, came back, and said "hey, I remember when you were here at that training a few weeks ago. Didn't you say that you left your charger?

Lol that's hilarious, I did the same too until my wife bought me one before vacation.  I told her to take it back because it's a pain in the ass to use because it's so tiny.  She then just looked at me in a blank stare like I was the dumbest person on earth, and then slowly assembled it.  I just put my head down and shook my head.  LMAO at the visual

"What is this, a toothbrush for ants?!?"Wow.... so i just had my “ooooooooooh” moment. As someone who lived in hotels for 3 years and used these often, i had no idea.....

i can’t even right now.Furthermore, the reason they go through the expense of building a tower, rather than just installing a pump, is all about disease prevention.

 It's important to understand that ALL water distribution systems leak. It's just the way it is. As long as pressure is maintained in the pipes, all this means is that some water leaks out. It's an expected loss, and is not a huge deal. If, however, you lose pressure in the pipes, even for a short period, ground water will to leak **into** the pipes. Untreated, unclean water, carrying God knows what bacteria and germs. Now the whole system is contaminated, and every single water main needs to be thoroughly flushed and tested before the water can be considered safe to drink. That's a very big, expensive, problem with big public health implications.

So rather than maintaining pressure with a pump that might fail or lose power, water towers are used. Gravity is unlikely to fail anytime soon.Actually..... dual purpose.  Elevating the water is the cheapest long-term way to pressurize system. But you need storage anyway. This way you may not have to build reservoir.ooooh that makes a lot more senseBonus: They are almost always about 40m (130ft) high so they deliver enough water pressure for fire hoses, etc.GisnepME TOO. I was definitely an adult before I realized. So glad I'm not alone. Even now, when my brain knows it's a D, I still see it as a backwards G. Add the content of the can to a pot together with one can of water.

Where are the cans of water?In contrast, the "hearty" soups *don't* need water added to them.No regrets. The only way I eat Campbells chicken noodle soup is condensed, no water added. 

My mom had made it that way for me when I was like 5. Not sure how I haven't had a heart attack yet. But its my favorite soup. My sister is 11 years older than me,  one day when I was around 15 we were at lunch having clam chowder and she had tossed me her oyster crackers like she literally always has and I ask finally her "Why don't you like oyster crackers? They're so good! I don't think I've ever asked why because I like getting an extra pack" and she says "Well, you know I don't like oysters" and I stared at her for a moment before I started laughing really hard and eventually told her that oyster crackers don't have fucking oysters in them. I stopped getting an extra pack because she tried them and likes them but I do have an embarrassing story to share, lol. This is cute, lol I had an uncle that I bragged to friends would ride his bicycle all year round!  Even in winter!  This uncle wasn't exactly a fitness buff either.  I marveled at his commitment to bicycling until I was an adult and learned that his driver's license had been suspended for years. You can also use the 2x4s and a sheet of plywood to make a support for an air mattress, then stow your camping gear in the space underneath. Great tent-free car camping set up. I was six when JFK was shot and I came home from school for lunch and my mum and siblings were gathered around the TV.

In the corner of the TV screen, it said "LIVE," so I thought he was still alive and that if he died, it would change to "DEAD."

YEARS later, I was like, "OOOOooooooh."This has got to be the most haunting comment in this entire thread.  I, too, remember that sound and didn't realize until today what it was.....got me right in the feels.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM4CMtsdNjY

For the lazy and people who want to feel sad.
Holy shit, I was an adult then and just assumed it was nearby buildings' alarm systems having been set off. I had to Google PASS alarm, the sound it makes, and the 9/11 footage.

Jesus Christ, that's fucked up.I still don't understand how the files don't fall out with the end tapered like that.But why do they sell files without handles?  I've never seen any other tool sold like that.  Nobody's selling a screwdriver with just the head, or a chisel with just the blade.My cousin did this once, well something like it. I had my can of pepper spray on my dresser and my mom and I were going through clothes to give to her. All of a sudden I can't breathe, my eyes are burning and i turn around and she has sprayed it in the air Bove my room and on her clothes. She thought it was perfume . I teased her forever about that.Omg. This is news to me. 

I always thought that “talkie” was such a dumb name. Like really people couldn’t think of a better name than “talkie”? I’ll never be able to say “movie” without feeling dumb. I've never seen these and I've traveled a fair bit both inside and outside the USA.You found the Piece of Resistance! That's an awesome memory to have with your grandfatherSimilar-ish story here. 

My dad and I were working on my car. When we were done, I backed down off the ramps and started cleaning up tools. We find this rubber rectangle. It was smooth on one side and had a pattern like sneaker treads on the other side. We're scratching our heads, googling car parts, etc. We spent a good 15 minutes speculating about where this piece of "engine hardware" came from. We eventually give up and hope for the best. 

I go to hand him a ramp to put away, and notice that there's little rubber feet on them. That match the "mysterious" car part exactly. Nice. Cheer up, it could have been an enema bag.I did this to a condom. I just thought my parents were hiding their cool, individually wrapped balloons so I wouldn't play with them. Blew that sucker right up. It did confuse me why it was all lubed up and gross tasting, but a balloon is a balloon. English isn't my native language. I scrolled through this whole thread apparently to find out where the insult douchebag comes from. TIL, I guess.Never knew what a douchebag was untill i googled it just now, this must be an American thing right?

Never ever heard of these (other than as an insult word used by americans in movies/videos).You had me at "I mouthed a douchebag."

I'm glad the story was actually as good as that promising intro. This is the first one in the thread that legitimately got me. Holy crap.Did you think it was for their sweaty forearms?in the 80s or so, it was much more common to have the sweatband for your head, but that fell out of style.   While it's dorky, it's also very practical.Bonus question: what's the point of the prongs going outwards?  Love of danger?used to 'pin' documents together for a temporary holdWhat the fuck. I just learned that. 
   
Here is a video explaning how - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA-ctIkI5Mg  Ow ow ow the thought... Ask a woman about pube hair snags on the adhesive. It's brutal. This reminds me of a male friend of mine once asking if I can see the egg when I have my period.

I told him yes, and it's tradition for women to save them so we can hide them for children at Easter.For a split second after reading "You use a hair tie" I thought the exact same thing ha. I was like howww?My first thoughts was literally about how uncomfortable that must be and how would you even get it on there, and then I saw wrist and was like "ohhh, wrissstt, okayy yeah i can see that"Well she really should have specified. I was assuming hair.Newborns are so exhausting that I'm surprised the teacher didn't realize that everyone in her class has diminished mental capacity and make that clear up front. I figured this out by accident--i just felt a small hole and realized there was a fabric pocket inside and just pulled at it until the stitches came out. Still not much of a pocket, but it's a pocket I guess.Except female clothing that has fake pockets.They’re often done up because the tailoring sits nicer when they don’t open. So I would say leave them unless you’re regularly needing them open but yea - there is a pocket in there. I've also seen people walking around in public with the little "X" stitches still holding the jacket vent(s) closed in the back.Someone fill me in? I'm now confused as to what that piggie was doing.

Edit: OH NOFuck me, you're right! Now I feel dumb.I can't wait to pick up my kid from school today and look at her back pack...I just rushed to my backpack in hopes of finding a whistle on my buckle, turns out I don't have a whistle but I've found out that [my bag has a mystery USB port on it.](https://imgur.com/a/fm4qk)Awesomely helpful except nobody knows it’s there.   
PS just checked around the house and none of 5 BP have whistles.  So last year in AP English, we always did a "Good Things" segment before starting class, and one person repeated this fun fact and blew the whistle for like half of these things.Confirmed! I have a really nice NorthFace backpack I got for Christmas, and it has one!!


Just blew it in the office, was way louder than I expected...whoops.the only reason i know what a dumbwaiter is because harriet hid in one while spying in a book titled

wait for it

harriet the spyI had this exact same experience.welp, learned something new today!  That's why i love these types of threads, there's always at least one tidbit of info you were missing out on. I had always wondered just how they were intended to ever clean pipes given that they are so much smaller than plumbing pipes.  I had always just assumed they were called that because they *look* like the bigger pipe cleaning things that are used elsewhere.Same.  Secondary head-scratcher: the kid is okay with mom cheating on dad, as long as there are presents involved.TIL it wasn't John from over the road kissing mummy... It was my Dad... It was my Dad right? Please tell me it was my Dad.....This is how my mom told me Santa isn't real. I was singing this and she said, "you know what that means? Because Santa isn't real, it's supposed to mean the mommy is kissing the Dad." I already figured out the truth on my own, but always thought she could have had a gentler tactic regardless.It's like calling tissues Kleenex. Stupid brand names..Welp now that you say that it makes complete sense. This perfectly with blink 182's thing too. Wanna know what "Dude Ranch" is referring to? 

Hint: it's not a ranch for dudesWere you disappointed when it was still impossible to get most of the crumbs out?Kind of Christmas related, but I was at a county fair with my then girlfriend, and we were walking around the animals. I said, "let's go check out the reindeer."

"Haha. Very funny."

"What?"

"Reindeer aren't real! They pull Santa's sleigh!"

After I introduced her to the reindeer, she called her mom and yelled at her for never teaching her that reindeer were real.My girlfriend used to live in Hawaii, she couldn't believe I didn't know how pineapples grew. Yea it's pretty weird. It's just a stalk with a pineapple on top.If I don't smear poop on their heads, how else will  they learn not to shit themselves?  Was still in hospital the day my daughter was born. I knew this fact from Reddit. When the baby needed changing, I did it from the top down, just in case. *The freaking midwife* didn't know baby vests did that!

Two weeks ago (16 months later), I mentioned it to the childminder (a professional), in front of another mother. *Neither of them* knew about it!

I got some serious dad kudos points from that one Reddit tip...Baby vests = onesies for us Americans btw

Edit: since multiple people are asking me - [envelope shoulders](http://www.njfamily.com/images/cache/cache_a/cache_0/cache_5/baby-onesie-imag-ee42c50a.jpeg?ver=1490195726&aspectratio=0.66722268557131)I picked up a bucket at HD a couple weeks ago and like you, I carried it around and filled it up with stuff.  I got to the cash, and the lady almost didn't scan it through cause she assumed I was just using it as a basket.  She said lots of people do that, so maybe you aren't alone! As for me, I needed the bucket. When I was a kid, I was at home Depot with my dad. We were in the checkout line. There was this button just hanging out there next to the candy and shit that said "Do not press." Of course I push. The company wouldn't let anything important be at arm's reach of children and idiots like myself. 

This terrible high pitched alarm started SHRIEKING. The cashier gives me this dead eyed 'kill me right fucking now look'. We waited 5 minutes, which is a long fucking time when everyone in home Depot is trying to murder you with their eyes, for a manager to come and deactivate it. 

To this day, I have no idea what it was for. Was it part of the store's security system? Did it call the police? Was it part of some ill-conceived social experiment? I'm hoping so body here will be able to resolve the question that have been nagging me for a good 20 years. Nah, as a former home depot employee it is to sell more buckets. Management knows because corp tells us to put them there and at the end of every aisle for just that reason. A lot of the associates are dolts though.That's actually a normal thing to do so don't feel weird. Source: go to HD every day Bucket is a weird word when you read it over and over.In the US, we usually have the large shopping carts or the small carry baksets.  In other countries I had been in for a long time, they have baskets with a long handle so you can wheel them around and they're very convenient.

I think I was at Target in the US, and I saw that they finally had the long handled basket, so I grabbed it and went shopping.  Half way through, I started wondering, why didn't they put wheelies on this? 

Turns out, I had grabbed the stand that holds the carry baskets with only one basket remaining, and was just dragging the stand around the store with me.  An old girlfriend took step dancing classes at a Hibernian hall.  The classes were held in a room upstairs which meant passing through the clubhouse/bar sort of a thing on the ground floor where these nice old guys would always say hi to her and make her feel welcome.  So for years after she always associated the funny smell that always seemed to be hanging around in that room with those nice old guys and the cozy environment of the hibernian hall. 

Then when she was a teenager she went to her first concert and realized that smell was weed and those dudes were high AF every day.My neighbor had a room like this. I thought the black lights and strobe lights and grateful dead posters were so awesome. Turns out it was just where his older brother probably smoked pot.When I was a child there was a really warm, humid room in the back of our basement - in the middle of a Canadian winter this was wonderful. I loved playing in "the jungle" room. It disappeared around the time I was in grade six and learning about how "drugs are bad." Years later when I learned that my dad used to grow in the house everything made a little bit more sense and my childhood memories were tainted forever. I just thought my dad really liked to garden...In fairness to you, learning that you car can move with clutch control alone shows you've mastered manual transmission pretty well.  It finally clicked for me when a friend showed me that.
I was always told by my instructor just to use the clutch. On my test I had to reverse around a corner up a hill for my maneuver, so that was when I discovered that you could the accelerator too. Pretty lucky piece of guess work.This is one of the only threads that I have ever read start to finish... And I'm prolly gonna save it and come back later. I'm also encouraged that I know many of these. Kinda the same feeling I get when I can answer 6 questions on jeopardy.Thanks, I never picked up on that before!Ive always used this slider to tighten the cord to my neck, reducing dangle and cord noise, especially useful when runningMy brother told me the logo had to be turned the right way or else you'd be ruining your disks. Can January February March? No, but April May

edit: shit lmao I just said this to confuse OP for another 16 years. i didn't mean for it to actually mean anything hahahahDo you mean Rear View Mirror?You know it's called a "rear-view" mirror....*right?*I figured this one out pretty easily because growing up, my mom only used the sandwich bags with the flap that folded over the sandwich. I never had the Ziploc bags like the cool kids.Well fuck me. I've been scrolling through these comments feeling so smug. I need to go fix my pillow cases.This is how I normally have to open my XBox One. Don't buy refurbished goods off Groupon. I bought a carton of broth once and when I opened the plastic cap, the foil was broken. So I took it back to the store and asked for another. The same thing happened. After a quick Google search, I learned that the caps are made to pierce the foil when you first open it. I don't really like that though because you want to see the foil so you know that the carton hasn't been tampered with.Here is how it looks - https://i.imgur.com/CPfrIfX.jpgSo my best friend received a purse hook from this gentleman that stayed at her house as a hostess gift. 

She didn’t know what it was, but being the well-bred lady that she is, she wrote a thank you note, which I’ve paraphrased below. 

“ Dear Friend, 

Thank you for the item. I️ have found many uses for my item. The item is so thoughtful. 

See you soon! 

Best, 

Confused idiot” Fun fact: The queen of Britain carries around one with a little suction cup on that she sticks underneath tables.

The thought of her licking a suction cup and slamming it to the underside of a table is hilarious.The "cargo net". For containing cargo oddly enough.Plastic wrap will still be my nemesis. This is the happiest moment of my life. Fuck my kids they're not even close to this shit.Holy shit.

I literally went to check my aluminum foil just now and how did I never know about these.Those never really seem to work for me :-(Similar:  Some video games use a power called "Regen" which I pronounced like President Reagan for years before I realized it's short for Regeneration - soft G.  I still feel like an idiot for that one, though I think only my brother has heard me say it.  Just wait until you find out that many staplers have staple storage hidden inside the base.The other secondary purpose to that is a bottle opener.  That little hook is great at getting under the bottlecaps on glass beer/soda bottles.When I moved out I just forgot to buy one. And I used my swiss army knife as the can opener for a solid 2 years before I was staring at a proper can opener in the store and it finally clicked.A hollow tube takes much less material than a solid cylinder, and yes, they are stirrersIn your defense, one brand is called sip-n-stir. They're intended for both, just not for sipping hot liquids. They're also used for making mixed drinks which are usually cold and can be safely sipped through a (tiny) straw.

Here's a white version at Walmart: https://www.walmart.com/ip/Merchandise-55534411-Dixie-Sip-N-Stir-Straws-44-100-Count/904032195?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=1148&adid=22222222228107616557&wmlspartner=wmtlabs&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=m&wl3=223354423879&wl4=pla-388466640634&wl5=9023221&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&wl9=pla&wl10=112562587&wl11=online&wl12=904032195&wl13=&veh=semlol, oh man - that's the whole gameYou can also hit windows+L to lock your screen more quickly. Windows+R to open the "Run" menu - I find it's quicker to get to things like calc, notepad, & mspaint (all of which you can simply type in there to launch).

But the very best hotkey IMHO is Windows+(left or right arrow).  This will move the current window to that side of the screen and size it to take up exactly 1/2 the screen.  Win10 will then display all other open applications on the other side so you can pick which one you want displayed on the other half (or just click the one you already moved to leave everything else where it is).  It's a lifesaver if you want something open for reference while you work in another window.  And if you have multiple monitors, repeated pressing of Win+(arrow) will move the app to the screen in that direction.>on your toes.

You mean your foot-fingers?Some time ago there were no sub-reddits, all there was was an unending page of links you could comment on.Fucking christ. Thank her for me.I remember when mcflurrys first came out, I ordered one, when I saw the large plastic square thing sticking out I said to the cashier "That's a cool straw" I proceeded to try and drink my mcflurry for longer than I'm willing to admit before I realized it was a spoon.Bacon is also pork.What animal did you think ham came from?I didn't realize that pickles were just **cucumbers** drowned in vinegar until I was older then you. I simply thought there was a veggie called "a pickle." I don't even remember what prompted the realization but it was a powerful (and mildly embarrassing) moment.

I've since learned that pickling is really just a process and that tons of produce can be pickled.

Edit: it's turning out it's not an uncommon misconception. Interesting. 

Edit: not just vinegar but brine, etc.Oh God. I'm from Europe and don't drive a ton but I was at a gas station and could not get the pump to work at all... I tried like 3 different pumps too. Finally a man came up to me asking if everything was alright and I told him that the pump was just refusing to pump for me. Well it turns out that some pumps have a little metal handle that you flip upwards. There is literally a sign above it that says "lift handle" but I thought it was referring to the injection handle that you stick in your car. I was so embarrassed. 

I... I feel like this isn't actually a thing, and is just a really punny pun.holy shit!That's the epitome of unfortunate.Also, they make a smaller version of this to use on bathroom sinks. You plunge with one hand and use your other hand to cover the vent (some people call it the over flow drain). It will usually clear anything stuck in the P trap very quickly.   “Knowledge is power, France is Bacon”Best one ive seen online is "its a doggy dog world"  he heFun fact. Spaghetti is plural. If you has a single noodle, it's called a spaghetto.TIL that thing is called a spaghetti spoonOr buy a 6 pack of rolls but forget you don't have the handle anymore so you use a Butterknife for like half the pack...Hang on... you can what?Are you my mother in law?And the correct amount of table for one cup is... Mhm, it was pretty earth shattering for me too.Those pills will last you a lifetimeI lost a phone in a river and when I went to buy a new one (knowing insurance wasn't going to cover it) the rep kept telling me that insurance covered it being stolen but not lost. Eventually, I caught on and asked how that works, but then they told me I had to submit a police report, so I decided against it. That's exactly it. Clapperboard goes clap in the audio track and smack in the video tape, you line that one bit up manually, and then everything else will be lined up, too. 

Plus because it's so loud, audio editing programs with visualizers have an easily noticeable jump where the clapping is. I'd assume that the weird pattern on the board probably helps somehow, too.When I was really young, my dad and I were walking back to the car in a parking lot, and I asked him where all the yellow lines came from in the parking lot. I think he misunderstood my question, or wasn't listening well, because he told me "it was from the sun." It blew my mind as a little kid, and confused me sooo much how the sun was able to make such bright vivid lines that looked like they were painted, *and* that the sunlight also coincidentally made it in the perfect rows of the perfect shape for parking spaces for vehicles, *and* it ONLY did this in parking lots. Like, my mind was blown and confused at how perfect that all worked out.There are green lights at the tp and bottom transitions of escalators. They are part of the escalator building code. They are there to show clearly that the escalator is in motion. The light shines through the gaps in the steps. When the escalator is running the light apears to strobe.

edit: so my highest voted comment is me praising someone elses comment....
I'll take the karma npThe battery died in my Nissan Cube fob relatively often, as in every couple of months. It crazy annoying because when the battery dies, the basic functionality that you took for granted previously is now not available, so everything is a massive hassle (ie pushing a button to unlock the door, pushing a button to start the car). This never seemed like an advancement in technology for me; I had an Oldsmobile in high school that started with a simple metal key that never required any kind of service. The dealership would replace the battery (for a cost), but they always said things like, “you shouldn’t leave the key in the car” (I don’t do that) or “the car will still start if the battery is dead, you just need to hold the fob on the button” (that sometimes doesn’t work). Anyway, one day I’m getting dropped off by the owner of the dealership (my transmission had gone) and he says, “Oh there is your problem, your house is too small.”  Apparently because of where we hang our key by the front door is too close in relation to the driveways, so our key is constantly trying to communicate with our car.  Their solution? Keep the key in our fridge.This has saved me a few times and i only just discovered it on reddit last year and been driving for 10.I'm always confused by the discarded dildos. sex toys are expensive why are they treating them as one-useWhat like someone just wants to spin a salad? I don't make salads at home really, so it would never even occur to me what they are used for. I thought it was for people too lazy to "toss a salad."At least you didn’t do it on camera.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qQthwyF2LqYIt's specifically for bagels with toppings that will get burnt and nasty if you apply heat directly to that side.

1:48 she explainsHaha, so it's not just me!Often the switch is tied to only certain outlets, or even just part of certain outlets. Take a small lamp around and you'll figure out how yours is wired.We just figured out what the random light switch in our garage led to.  A outdoor socket in the eve for Christmas lights!  Genius wish I'd figured that out last yearYou could just have a plastic bag full of other plastic bags instead of wasting your money.I worked at a place that had strict policies on locking your work station,  but also asinine password complexity rules. 30 character passwords with no words permitted and two attempts to get it right before the account locks and you have to call to have your account reenacted means a lot of people gambled waking away from stations. We started to have random floor checks. When I walked away I'd just click my monitor off. One time I was recognized for being the only person that month who "properly" locked a workstation. Clearly what we need is ANOTHER egg carton, then to do it twice. Let's start an indigogo for a plastic one made in china.This is the same reason you shouldn't use fabric softeners on towels. They don't dry as well because they become less absorbent. 

Edit: I have blown many minds today. In case you're serious (and in this thread, apparently, one can't be too careful), after you've dumped the contents of the soup can into the pot, you refill the now-empty can with water (or milk), maybe swirling it a little when it's half full to get the leftover soup off the sides, and then pour that canful of water (or milk) into the pot as well. It's just convenient for measuring.My great-grandfather had a can of "Dehydrated Water" in his cupboard. The label included instructions to mix with water and stir.On the other hand, "powdered" soups *do* need water added to them. Yeah, one of our co-workers got written up in the company newsletter "Alex walks to work, fit and losing weight." No, Alex had been out to the bar in the next town, when he couldn't drink any more, he got into his nice shiny new pickup, started driving home, and crashed into a tree (knocking it over) right in front of the Mounties' building in town.  No license for 2 years, had to keep making payments on a written off truck, insurance didn't cover DUI, and his wife told him "Don't expect me to drive you to work."I'm sorry, but that's *hilarious*.Went to look up a video of someone using a steel file, so that you could make it a gif. Instead, I found multiple instances of people using a file without the handle. I give up.LPT: files are designed to be pushed onlySo you can change it easily when the old file is finished. Think about it, if you often use a file and don‘t let it rot in a corner, the file will soon not have any „bite“ to it, but the handle os still useable. Thus you can throw it into the metal trash and not have to do any sorting.Let's zip to when I was 22 and living with my inlaws... Bf at the time cooked a three course meal for our anniversary. His mother left her pepper spray on the table...my bf..bless his soul...pulled the same number. Sprayed it in the air not knowing it was pepper spray and you can only imagine the look on my face as we inhaled that gas. Needless to say, dinner was thrown away after we hacked our lungs out on the balcony. He is THE SPECIAL!!Or an ear-syringing bulb.Me too. I found it (wrapped) at my friend Rachel's house. Played with it for a while, got lube all over my face and then I think I just left it there. 

The horror of finding a flappy old condom on your 7 year-old daughter's bedroom floor.Spent the night at a friends house in middle school and found some of her dad's condoms. I think we kinda knew what they were for but had never seen one so we open it up. We blew into it and did the silly balloon thing but then decided to step it up. We threw it in the sink and filled it with water expecting it explode. It didn't. It filled the entire sink. Then we were curious, what would make the thing pop? In the myth busters style of over doing it, we went to the bathtub and attached it to the bathtub facet. We watched in fascination as the thing nearly filled the entire bathtub before exploding in a watery mess everywhere after one of us poked it. I though their wrists got sweaty.

Or the pockets that are so small, they're useless. I get it that they're only there for fashion/the pants look better with rather than without... but man, it's not like we're asking for cargo shorts. It's embarrassing to admit that I never googled it.. especially since it was such an irritation to me. But yeah, after I learned they really are pockets, I googled it and read exactly what you said- don't open em unless you plan on using them. I typically leave the external breast pocket sewed shut on my jackets. I open the back pockets on slacks since I'll put a phone, wallet, or something in either back pocket on the regular.Indeed. I would likely recommend snipping the vents at least, but the pockets are optional if you need them.

Edit: To be clear, snip your vents. Not optional, haha.The whole poem is pretty dark.

My cousin went to take her driving test.  They started out of the lot, it started raining, and the instructor went, "Can't test in the rain.  Turn around and park."  She expected to have to wait for the rain to stop or to come back another day; nope, she got her license after less than 2 minutes of driving.The lyrics to that song are one of my favorite topics, so here are a few more:

First off, the core of the song's meaning is the death of Buddy Holly. That's what the song is mostly about, although it contains a lot of other interesting references. When he's talking about delivering newspapers with bad news in February, and crying about "his widowed bride" that's all about Buddy Holly.

> When the jester sang for the king and queen
> 
> In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
> 
> And a voice that came from you and me

He's talking about Bob Dylan here, who was sometimes called The Jester, and appeared on an album cover wearing a coat that looked a lot like Dean's. His voice "came from you and me" as Bob was known for being the voice of the common folk.

> The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
> 
> Eight miles high and falling fast

This is a reference to The Byrds and their hit Eight Miles High.

> While sergeants played a marching tune

He's talking about The Beatles' Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.

> So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
>
> Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
>
> 'Cause fire is the devil's only friend
>
> 
> Oh and as I watched him on the stage
>
> My hands were clenched in fists of rage
>
> No angel born in Hell
>
> Could break that Satan's spell

This whole section is a reference to the stabbing death of a fan at the Altamont concert by Hell's Angels (angel born in Hell) who'd been hired as security. The Rolling Stones were on stage when it happened.

> I met a girl who sang the blues
> 
> And I asked her for some happy news
> 
> But she just smiled and turned away

This is about Janis Joplin's death.

And finally, here's one no one has ever figured out:

> Do you recall what was revealed
> 
> The day the music died?

No one knows what Don's talking about in those lines and he has always refused to say.

There are a ton more references in that song; almost every line is a reference to something or someone from that era of music right around the time when Buddy Holly died. It's a lot of fun to try to deconstruct.

6 starsThe weight of the purse and the angle of the holder itself hold it on?you ever use the heavy duty restaurant-size plastic wrap dispensers that you could literally kill someone with?  the roll lasts forever, it's like 3 feet wide, and even has a little knife slider that does the cutting for you.  so instead of wrangling that shitty little strip that ends up curling into itself because you suck at tearing, with this you just slide the slider across one time and it effortlessly cuts the piece for you perfectly every time

I'm surprised keeping them on hasn't caught on in an ironic sort of way. Not saying I'd like that at all... just kinda wouldn't shock me lol. Night is falling. There are only a few scattered cars left at the Broadway Boulevard Target in Tucson Arizona. It's far from closing but the store is already vacant, save for an eerily calm woman, a sobbing child, and a cowering employee.

The woman stares blankly down at the employee from her glider rocker she claimed as a throne, her eyes devoid of empathy and weary from her long journey. She slowly taps the revolver against the armrest and sips her latte from the in-store starbucks. "I'm waiting..."

"Ma'am, please..." The employee whimpers, trying to tie a torn off piece of his khakis above the fresh bullet wound in his leg. His hand slips in the blood and he whimpers softly. "I don't know what you want..."

She scans the piles of backpacks scattered around the boy. "That's a lie."

"Mom..." The girl softly pleads. She gingerly holds up a box to her mother, the colorful plastic inside a stark contrast to the darkness that now clouds her once cheerful mothers face. "We can just buy a whistle and put it on the ba-- AAHHH!" She cries out as the woman swats the box away from her daughter without looking.

"That wasn't an option two states ago and it's not one now." She sips her latte again. "He'll just have to check the back."

"This is everything we have!" The boy cries. "You watched me take our entire inventory out!"

"Check again." She levels the gun at him.

"I can't!"

She pulls back the hammer.

"There's nothing to check!"

The girl grabs her mothers arm. "Please, mom! Not again!"

The woman says nothing. In the distance sirens can be heard. They are briefly drowned out by a single gunshot. The police won't find the perpetrator, she's already taken her daughter and left. They will, however, be treated to the grisly scene of what was once a healthy 18 year old stockboy, his body splayed out among childrens backpacks with whistles shoved into his every orifice. They won't understand what it means.

Edit: One thing I just remembered about that job. We had a manager who, since the time I started working there, couldn't speak above a whisper no matter how hard she tried. It had been like this for years. Two years after I was hired, she finally found a doctor who figured out the problem. Apparently, if you're stressed out every single day for years on end, it can cause a psychogenic voice disorder. He ordered her to take 3 months off work. When she came back, she could speak normally.When I was in high school I had a friend who was not the smartest. I remember him telling me if I didn’t want to get a woman pregnant, then she should be on top so the sperm can’t flow up. He became a father his sophomore year. [removed]"You know, son, there really is no such thing as cheating if you aren't married. The Bible doesn't recognize any relationship that isn't bound in the covenant of the Lord. So until you are married, relationships don't really exist."

"Thanks Dad, you just indirectly explained why you're on your third marriage."I called Kids Help Phone when I was a teen to ask for advice on how to help my depressed friend. They advised I find new friends. I wish I was making this up.

edit: To clarify, the conversation was VERY short. I explained my friend has been struggling, depressed with no motivation and isolating herself from others, along those lines (it was a while back) and what can I do. The only piece of advice they gave me was to "let her sort it out on her own" and "find new friends". That's it. Nothing to interpret or misinterpret I don't think. We remained friends though and shes alright now.Had a manager tell me I had to choose between my family and my job, and that I should choose my job. 

"40 hours a week isn't enough, you need to spend 80 hours working to get ahead in life"

Best part was it was the "decision" she made earlier in life. Her and her husband are workaholics, and had a daughter. She basically dumped the daughter off on grandma to raise, and is proud to tell this story.Mentioned in passing that my boyfriend suffered from a terrible charlie horse in the middle of the night. My bizarre, space cadet of a co-worker heard this and immediately interjected, frantically explaining that I needed to get him to a hospital because this was a surefire symptom of pregnancy. She also recommended that I call the news because my boyfriend is well... a man. I guess she thought history was about to go down. 

Spoiler alert: he wasn't pregnant.When my marriage was on the rocks my dad said "Son, go out and find yourself an older woman that just wants to f**k and keep your marriage. She (wife)  doesn't have to know, you'll be getting laid and the older woman will be happy without a commitment."

Thankfully....I didn't go that route, and my marriage is repaired and stronger than ever today.[deleted]When my daughter was an infant, my wife couldn't breastfeed and my daughter couldn't digest formula very well, so I had to buy a special predigested formula for like $25/can.

I was at the cashier paying for the formula. The guy in front of me was gathering his things. He said to me, he says, "When my kids were babies, I wish I knew what I know now."

I was like, "What's that? What do you know?"

He says, "Babies don't need formula. All they need is sugar water. All the rest is a scam." 

I was like, "I'm so glad you didn't know that back then."Guy at my work once told me that as long as you didn't physically block the exit, it wasn't considered rape.

My Chemistry teacher at the time scheduled a substitute, personally drove me to a nearby college, and sat there with me while I spoke with admissions.  

Fast forward a few years....

After receiving a Chemistry and Chemical Engineering dual degree and then going on to get a PhD in Chemical Engineering....I'd say that guidance counselor knew jack shit.

**tldr: my guidance counselor said I "wasn't college material" ... and was proven to be full of shit**"Just listen to your academic advisor. They know what they're doing."

I am so thankful for my new boss, but I am even more thankful for old boss... for giving me the worst advice I've ever received in my life."I have an open-door policy so don't hesitate to come see me if you have any issues at all!"
 
I learned the hard way to never trust any boss or HR rep that says that shit. Utilizing open-door policies is a damn good way to get fired for being a "troublemaker".  When I was little I told my mom I was sad because some kids were bullying me. She said I should tell them that when they bullied me it hurt me inside, and they would stop. I did what she said. This was bad advice. They did not stop."don't go through chemotherapy, eat this nut and berry mix instead!"- my younger sister, when she visited me in the hospital when I went for febrile neutropenia (no white blood cells, had fever). She also showed up claiming to have bronchitis and didn't wear a mask and full-on hugged me. Yeah she's a piece of work.

Even knowing what I do now about what it would do to my reproductive health (TL;DR: permanent menopause at 26), I'd still go with chemotherapy 1100%. I was going to DIE without it, with a 100% guarantee. I would be dead by the time I turn 27. My life is more important than my ability to have children the old fashioned way. 

Added to clarify: I was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, co-classified with bulky disease and was receiving chemo for it. The febrile neutropenia was a side effect of the treatment.My psychiatrist told me I could stop taking the SNRI antidepressants I was on more or less cold turkey. It was technically safe but holy shit, it was a tough couple of weeks...partly because of unpleasant physical sensations and partly because it was the closest to actual crazy id ever felt. "Buy a house [in 2006].  It'll be the best decision you ever make!"

Worst decision I've ever made.When I found out I was pregnant with my youngest son my mom and her boyfriend told me to abort. Not because I couldn't afford the baby, or that there was something wrong with him, but because my mom was going through menopause and didn't want to be reminded that she couldn't have any more kids. 

Edit: wow, i work nights, posted this when I got home from work and just woke up. Holy crap! Thanks for the gold, kind people. And to answer some questions, no I was not pregnant with my sons baby, I was pregnant with my son who was the baby. Yes, this did happen, no my mom is no longer with the boyfriend because he ran out of money, yes I still am in contact with her because she has had some sort of mental breakdown and is living in my house. Yes I hate her, but my brother noped the f out when my mom threatened to punch his wife because she wanted my mom to vacuum her room because she had bugs, so instead of her being homeless, we let her live with us. I wish I had noped out too but 40 years of abuse can fuck with a person. Yes I had my son, he's 10. I was 30 when I had him. My husband and I are still together. 

I will answer and reply to everyone here in a few minutes. I really had no idea that this would be so huge. Just have kids, you'll figure out how to afford them later.‘Just open another credit card, it’s free money’ coming from my friend who is in thousands of dollars worth of debt and has no idea she will eventually have to pay that off. 

Edit: Whoa! Now I finally understand about the exploding inbox comments, this was my first ever post on reddit. 

Also another gem this same girl thought she would get a marketing job right out of college that would pay her 70k a year and she ‘wouldn’t take anything less because she would be selling herself short’ 

"Don't be afraid to seek help at Mental Health, it won't adversely affect your Air Force career."

I've been turned down for two amazing job opportunities because of my visits to Mental Health.

EDIT: To clarify, I'm already in the Air Force. I saw Mental Health for depression and anxiety related issues and was later rejected for new jobs within the AF because of those visits, despite assurances to and endorsements by several providors stating that my issues had been resolved. 

EDIT 2: Obligatory "this blew up" comment. Sorry I hardly replied to anyone, it's been a long and busy day for me. I do want to say I appreciate the outpouring of support from all of you (even if I'm not really worth your time). The last couple years of my life and career have been immensely frustrating, and it's put me in a dark place that I haven't really been able to escape since. I'm not planning to do anything stupid, don't get me wrong, but it's hard to see the proverbial light lately. I'm not giving up, I think I'm too stubborn to do that, but I have come to realize that I'm probably gonna be here for a while, so I might as well make myself comfortable.A friend of mine would always get me to talk about my relationships and would somehow twist the smallest things into seeming like they were really bad and then suggest that I should break up with them and I would be like "you're right! why am I putting up with this shit??" when it could have been something completely normal. Happened with 3 girls in a row and it was always the same stuff he said and I just snapped out of it one day and realised that I had been the shitty bf and the reason it didn't work was because of how I was acting after hearing all these things put into my head. Think he was just jealous because he could never get any girls but what a weird thing to look back on.

Edit: it's quite funny how many comments here are suggesting he was into me because we actually shared a bed for a few months years ago as he got kicked out of his apartment and had nowhere else to go and I was still living with my parents so the sofa was a no go. I feel unclean.Engineer, salaried, married with a kid. Also have a masters degree and several years of experience. VP of the company advised me to work at McDonald's after work if I wanted to make more money.

He even took his calculator out and told me how many hours I should work.

Edit: the guy was fired about a year after that for bullying employees. I tried to leave but ended up staying and turned down other jobs, not a bad place to be for now. I spoke about it to a couple of senior executive I trusted at the time.

Edit 2: legally married to an adult female. The kid is the result of said marriage. Just for the records...In my final semester of college, my insanely jealous, distraught mother called me to make one last plea to get me to drop out.  She went on to say "What would you do if you had to watch helplessly as your own daughter threw her life away and became a *nurse*?!"

By the way, she married an elementary school drop out, and was a bitter retail worker.  She couldn't handle watching me be the first in the family to graduate from college and make something of myself, and she dealt with it by constantly shaming me.  If I scored 99% on something, she complained about the last 1%.  If I got 100%, she said I was stupid because I didn't earn bonus marks.  We don't talk anymore and I'm a successful nurse.

**Edit:** Thanks for all the kind comments!  This got more attention than I would have thought, because this is really mild in comparison to some of the things my mother has said and done to me.  As is tradition, I received the typical "Well, I hope you still love her and talk to her!  Be the better person!" response that survivors of childhood abuse often receive.  If your abuser won't stop, there is nothing wrong with leaving and never looking back.  Yes, even if it's your mother.  This is me being the better person and respecting myself and my children enough not to subject us to abuse.This wasn't me personally but my mom told me that we had a neighbor that used to constantly tell my dad that life insurance was a waste of money and tried to convince him to stop paying for it. Fortunately my dad was intelligent because he died five years later and my family would have been completely destroyed without it.
“I’m having trouble getting to sleep at night”

“Oh, you just need to go to bed earlier.”Someone told me that I should have kids in my early 20's so I can just get it out the way.“Your family is the only thing that will ever be there for you. Not your friends, your *family*.”

Annnd I just got excommunicated from my narcissistic, abusive family two days before thanksgiving.My careers advisor in high school.
When I said "I think I want to do something with computers" she said "have you heard of Microsoft?"
Then she wrote Microsoft on a piece of paper and slid it across the table and that was my careers interview over.anything in any romantic comedy ever"Stop reading! You read too much, you're going to hurt your eyes! Go watch tv for awhile!" My grandma, every time she visited, while grabbing the books from my hands. It was like something off The Simpsons.
I had a crap car in college, and didn't really complain too much about it. My mom was apparently getting some pressure from some member of the extended family, or someone made a comment to her about it, and she decided to take it out on me.

She called me and told me "they" had all talked, and I need to drop out of school, and go work at a chicken factory for a year or two and get a decent car. I called my grandmother, and she was horrified, and no one said that to her. I have no idea what was going on, but I have had a very decent career, directly related to my degree. I was working at the time of the call, and had never asked them for a penny since I was 17 and started my first job. I also was consistently making good grades in school. They paid for my health insurance, but I was responsible for my car insurance, my school fees, any deductible from a doctor's visit, and all that. My cell phone, food, everything, I paid for it, so it's not like I was causing a huge financial stress to them.

Yeah, it was terrible advice. Glad I did not take it.

Edit: Wow, this has blown up! I did not expect this sort of reaction. I really appreciate all the interest in the story, and I thought I would just clear up a few things. First of all, while from this story it would appear my mother may be a narcissist, or something like that, that's not the case. My family had gone through a super traumatic experience prior to this, and it had a serious, extremely negative, impact on us all, her most of any of us. My mom was *not* ok at this time, but was not able to just step back, because if she did, things would have been even worse. She basically had a total breakdown, and after a life of helping others as a social worker, a mom, and all that, she had a meltdown after the previously mentioned traumatic experience happened. This is a woman that took all of her siblings out of an abusive home and provided for them for years, instead of leaving them in the abuse and taking care of herself, so not usually selfish or batshit crazy. There were some really horrible circumstances that led to that phone call, which did not involve me. However, I don't think she was in a place mentally to make any sort of major decision. She was absolutely nuts for a few years, and I guess       just, for lack of a better term, wigged out to epic proportions. Things are much better now. I understand many people grow up in narcissistic households, and I'm very sorry. I appreciate you all reaching out to me, and I get why you would think this was the case. In this situation though, there were a few isolated years of just a genuine crapshow, and then things became better again. 

In the context of the question though, the one asked on reddit, it was absolutely the worst advice I have ever received, so I stand by this example.  Don't judge my mom harshly on this though, as I didn't take it, and she doesn't even remember offering it to me. She was in a terrible place mentally, and said and did a lot of messed up things, but is better now by far.Have children as soon as possible.




No.8th grade geography exam is coming up, we've been studying the Middle East. Father has recently returned from Africa, where someone had incorrectly informed him that Israel is technically a part of Africa. He was extremely convincing. My teacher literally said "jesus we've been studying this for weeks kid." "stop thinking about depression there are more people who have greater problems than yours" non verba "Go see Jack and Jill, with Adam Sandler! Its funny!" - Todd, from accounting. Ignore the bullies. You don't need to fight them but standing up for yourself is far better than taking it, internalising it and letting it hold you back.“Take a piece of sandpaper and rough your nipples up before the baby comes.” - A coworker to pregnant me about breast feeding. My mother in law recently tried to solve my money issues. 

MIL: stupid question...why can't you just stop paying off the debt for a while? It will still be there in say 3-5 years or so. 

Wife and I: we can't stop paying we owe them money and have an agreement to pay a little off each month. Not to mention it has to do with my mother putting me in debt so I had to go to court I can't just not pay.

MIL: oh...well are you sure you couldn't just skip a few months? If you didn't have to pay it off right now you guys could get your own apartment.
   
 Yes thank you because we don't know that. It's a shitty situation that I kind of put myself in for trusting my mother. I can't just stop paying off debt especially with it being a court order. My mother in law seems to bounce between understanding and not constantly.  She like my mother also doesn't seem understand showing good faith that you will pay or are trying to pay something. In their mind "just wait until you have the full amount to pay off" by then there's interest and late fees and god knows what else. Anytime I explain it she gets it for a while and then goes right back to "can't you stop paying?" 

Edit: guys I do not live with my mother in law so no this is not her trying to get us to move out. She live about an hour from us. This was honestly how she thought we would solve our issues.  Because of the debt I mentioned I live with my mother because she put me in the debt so it's the least she can do. Yes I live rent free with my own mother because I currently pay about 900 a month to paying off debt. My mother in laws advice is to stop paying off court ordered debt payments so that we can move away from my toxic mother faster. 

Edit#2: people are asking about the debt and I should have expected that. 

I allowed my mother to put her electricity in my name so she wouldn't lose my two sisters who were minors at the time. Without my knowledge she put other bills in my name, paid them no problem for 5 years and then decided not to pay any of them. She got papers saying I had to go to court for the amount she racked up. After court fees and such it's about 15,000. She got these papers months before the date, I totaled my car a month before the date. She helped me pick out a car and let me take a 15000 loan knowing I had this debt and a court date. She told me about court a week before I had to go. I'm not interested in bringing my mother to court or sending her to jail. If I file bankruptcy I lose my car. I'm almost out of the debt she accumulated so I'll be where I thought I was when originally buying my car. This summer I hope to have enough to move away. I currently have to live with my mother because of all of the debt I'm paying off. I understand this is also my fault for trusting and allowing her to do this. 

Edit #3: thank you all for your kind words, and telling me this isn't my fault. It means a lot and I love you all for it! I've hopefully found at least one new sub for support as well, thanks again! 

Also for all the pms and other comments I be a lady lol College Roommate: Drink beer and nothing hard when you party. It fills you up so you’ll throw it up before you get alcohol poisoning and then you can drink more right away.Don't make any friends, Friends will ruin your lifeWhen I was about 5-6 years old I was given a Superman cape for my birthday, I was told that it could make me fly, after a few days of not being able to fly, I began asking people how to make it work, they advised that I needed to find somewhere high up to jump off of, so I started jumping off fences, trees, then I was told I needed to jump something taller.... I was miserable with the school I was in and wanted to study my dream career. A friend told me that no one does what they like and I should deal with it. I didn't.

Edit: I did leave and now I am about to get a degree on the career I love! I know things will be tough but I don't regret it! In my country most of us are out of job so I figured, if I'm going to be unemployed, better be at something I like!"Schedule all your college courses at 8 am, then you've got the rest of the day to relax!"Somebody told me girls like to be smacked around a little.

Pro tip: always ask first.When you're undecided about what to do with your life and people say "Do what you're passionate about/ love" Well fucking thank you. Like, I'm obviously not that passionate about anything if I've got to ask this question right? "Just get over it."
-My mom, any time I had any sort of emotional, mental, or bullying issue."your high-school years will be the best ones of your life, so you better enjoy them while you can."

If high-school was the greatest time of my life, then i would have been better off killing myself then and there. Was advised to go to Bible college to find myself a "godly husband".

 Did not take that advice, and instead hung out at the engineering college and married an engineer When I was fresh out of the Navy and going to college on the GI Bill, my dad tried repeatedly to get me to drop out of college...he honestly thought that pursuing a biology degree at no cost to myself was a waste of my time. 

it wasn't until I started my masters degree that he was finally supportive of my educational goals. He tells me he's proud of me, and when I remind him that he tried to get me to drop out he denies it...Some guy told me to kill myself on the internet once."Do what you love and the money will come"Not me but I was there when my husband’s aunts told him that he needed to be more like his cousin. Everyone knew the cousin was worthless so it was shocking. At that time my husband was in college and working full time in IT, actually doing pretty well for himself while his cousin had a job at some stadium making $12 which they all thought was great. After their little pep talk they convinced his mom to agree. That’s when I told him I believed in him and they were crazy.  20 years later my husband is very successful while the cousin is in prison for child abuse.  Seriously his aunts were stupid cunts."Look at this cool new website. Its called Reddit."Have a baby - your marriage will get better. High school scheduling junior year, I couldn't fit a junior level basic computer class in because of calculus and band. The guidance counselor told me not to take calculus my junior year because I'd forget it all before college. Then when I told her no way, she said to drop out of band class, it's an elective and not important. All because she didn't want to have to remember that I needed to take that computer class my senior year instead. I have eczema and was told just not to itch.  When I was a teenager and had acne, none of the over the counter acne medicine was working. My mom brought me to a dermatologist and the medicine they prescribed was very expensive so before buying it, my mom searched for any home remedies  online. The home remedy she found was to use urine... the way to apply it was worse. My mom went to the store to buy supplies and for over a month I would pee into a diaper and place it on my face for 15 minutes as part of my morning routine. Worst advice I've ever taken.Given to me by a high school Headmaster.

I'll take my chemo and vitamin C, thanks.That you "need" to go to college. I was never dumb, but an awful student, meaning I hated school and physically going to class. Three years in I had about 9 credits and thousands of dollars in debt. Wound up dropping out without telling my parents cause I knew they wouldn't approve. Now about eight years later I have a solid career with plenty of advancement opportunities, have paid off my college debts (luckily two years was community college so it was nothing too crazy) and am significantly happier in general. Not everyone is meant for college, and I know on here it's fairly known but i think a lot of people still have a stigma against not having a college education. The only reason why youre unhappy is because you dont prayMy child is extraordinarily wild hearted and intelligent...and difficult to parent. When she was 3, I was told to “break her spirit” so she would learn to obey. 

Her spirit is the best and brightest I’ve ever known. No exaggeration, I’d die to protect it. I don’t take parenting advice from that person anymore. A parent told me consistently throughout my childhood that a) I wasn't good at math because [the parent] wasn't good at math and b) math is just tricks that teachers use to make you feel stupid. I almost failed 8th grade math because I thought I was bad at it

Years later (after moving away), I eventually discovered I love logic, math, and general hard problem solving. I was good enough to get hired at Facebook and worked there as an engineer for years. I make more money than my entire family combined, largely using the skills I was strongly advised I didn't have.“Renting is just throwing money away!”  Sure, if you know for a fact that you’ll be living in the same town for the next 10+ years and have a steady income.  Otherwise, stop rent-shaming!  Renting is a great option for people who are just starting out, move every few years, or are unsure where they want to end up.  Repairs are the responsibility of the landlord, and you can save a lot of money especially with a housemate or two.  

Edit: I was being funny about “rent-shaming,” calm down. As a kid I was bullied a lot. I was always told not to fight back and ignore them. The best thing to ACTUALLY do in that situation is hit back, for every insult throw one back at then, if you get hit then hit back twice as hard. Even if you lose the fight, if you make it painful enough to fight you they will move to an easier target. “Stop being depressed already.” 

They say it as if it’s a choice.*"Money can't buy happiness"*  
  
Bull*shit* it can't! Is it a guarantee? Of course not. But the only real sources of unhappiness in my life right now are financial -- paying medical bills, paying for school, making rent, etc.  
  
Otherwise I'm happy as a clam."be good at what you are doing and money will come you naturally/ you will be rewarded"--heard many times from employers who look for good employees to underpay  

"work hard and u will make money"--same as above."Be yourself."

On my first day of elementary school my mom dropped me off. Before I got out of the car she told me to not hang out with Hispanics or black people because they will get me into trouble. The real kicker was that we are Mexicans who just moved from Mexico City to the US. In high school my friends mom told me whoever you're dating should think you're going to leave them at any time, you should always remind them there are other people interested in you, and they're not your only option.

And those people you rarely have to kill with anything.

People will always be inclined to tell you not to take risks in life when your situation is stable, even if you are not happy.Any careers advice my dad has ever given me. The highlight has to be when he told me to become a doctor. As if a person of average intelligence and no education can just walk into a job as a doctor."You have to go to University and get a degree or else you'll never get anywhere." 

"You should really do English as well as Journalism so that you have something to fall back on. Media is a useless subject." 

I now have a degree I probably won't use and a fair amount of debt because I took my parents advice. Not all bad as I had a lot of awesome experiences at University and met my current girlfriend who I've been with for 6 years now. But it was the last time I took advice from my parents regarding an important, life changing decision.

But when my 2nd child was a toddler she wasn't sleeping through the night and being defiant.  My mother recommended I spank my baby in her crib...not sure how that's supposed to help her sleep. She also recommended I tie her to a chair when she refused to stay in time out.  She was dead serious!  Needless to say, I DID NOT FOLLOW HER ADVICE!  She was never mean to my kids, but I got tired of her verbal abuse to me, so I stopped talking to her.  Never looked back and have ZERO regrets.High School English teacher was a “hunter” and told the entire class “if someone has a gun pointed at you, just stick your finger in it.” The guy was a complete joke.Take out loans for college, do whatever it takes, even if you're broke, doesn't matter which major you get as long as you get a degree.

And women, well, look at a man other than your husband and you’re a whore.

I️ have some questionable family members. It's funny because Jesus literally says the exact opposite. Perving on the ladies is committing adultery in your heart.That's like saying that stealing from the mob isn't really stealing because the government doesn't recognize their business as legitimate. Short version: all actions have consequences. I once called a suicide hotline and told the lady that I was afraid my parents would disown me because I thought I was bisexual. She paused and then said "yeah, some kids go through that phase." Man this is worse than when I went to the doctor aged 17 for depression and he said write a journal of things that make me feel sad and eat more bananas. Something like this happened when I reported a friend’s suicidal depression to a high school counselor. She was being molested by her father.  The counselor told me that she was being dramatic and I should give her some space. Fk that guy. I chose to believe her then and I still do. 

Coda: we’re now in our 50s & she’s an EMT with a large family.  She regularly saves other people’s lives. A shithead thing to do but my senior year we were required to do so many hours of community service for my government class. Those who didn't complete it on their own were signed up for a hotline. So you'd have like  20 people there during a few weeks who didn't want to be there. 

I am not sure if they were recorded but know they weren't monitored very well because a classmate of mine told some kid who was being bullied to pay some other kid to beat that bullies ass. I feel sorry for those kids who called for help during those last weeks of the semester each year.When I was a kid I called and said I wanted to kill myself and the lady sighed and hung upHad a boss a few years ago ask everyone to do 20hrs/week of OT.

His reasoning is it’s what he did and all that kind of crap. I don’t care what people before me did or had to do to get by. I need the weekend so I can be a functional human being.Lol! Seriously!?

Thankfully I knew enough to know I didn't want to get $60k in debt for a degree, and took the community college to state school route. Much less debt.Yeah, my brother had someone tell him that babies can start eating solids 2-3 weeks after birth! The coworker who told him this has two children. While I was in nursing school we ran a weekend free clinic with RNs and NPs. A woman brought her 6 month old in and we all immediately could see something was wrong with him. When we asked what the child’s diet consisted of she said low fat almond milk because she read something on the internet about how a low fat diet is good (presumably for adults). No formula or any other supplement. Her child had been **surviving** on just almond milk since he was born. Considering how vital fat is to the growing brain, I can only imagine the consequences to his cognitive and neurological development. Sure, if his kids are hummingbirds....



EDIT: my highest rated comment on reddit and its one sentence about humming birds, haha. Thanks sugar water weirdo! I feel you on this.  Our son couldn't breastfeed (cleft palate) and he had a milk allergy.  Guess who got to buy the expensive $30/can alimentum formula (like you said, basically pre-digested - it had the basics broken down and wasn't essentially milk at that point).

It's great that advice came in from some other mothers about, 'Well, just try it a different way, the kid will latch" - no, no he won't lady>Guy at my work once told me that as long as you didn't physically block the exit, it wasn't considered rape.

The fuck...I'm curious as to the context of the conversation that led to this being brought up.I thought this was going another way about a fire exit or somethingYour mom sounds like a nut.Jesus Christ, *hand soap*?? I think /r/skincareaddiction would like a stern word with her. Your mom is nuts.I went tried a number of medications from Proactive to a few prescriptions but finally Accutane cleared everything up quickly and I've been essentially acne free for the past decade. My dermatologist said, in reference to the suicide effects of suicidal/depression, that most people taking it feel better because their acne is so quickly and effectively dealt with.Accutane has some real real real fucked side effects, but it worked for me too man. i saw a messege on slate.com that was do badly condescending about this I never went there again. 

not that they lose any money from my absence mind you.I up voted you but it was for your chemistry teacher. What a great person. lol, my counselor, Ms. Bug asked me what I was doing when I graduated. I said I was going to join the Marines and she said, "Good, because no college will take you anyway."

Didn't really both me because I knew it was probably true. Graduated with a 2.3 because I had to work full time the entire time I was in high school. Plus, I figured I would take the time to figure out what I wanted to do, and by then I would be in a position to have it paid for. Got out, went to community college and transferred to CU Boulder with a 3.9 and graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science.No. Usually if he acts like this to begin with, it will only get worse if you are submissive.i'm pretty sure this advice came from the actual rapistI’m having an issue at work. My boss is a major creep. To every woman. Doesn’t matter how old or young. My coworkers and I were talking about reporting him to HR because they have an anonymous line you can call. However, HR says nothing will ever come out of an anonymous tip because they need to be able to have your name and interview you, otherwise people would just be calling in fake information about anyone they don’t like. Nobody wants to be the first one that steps up and has their name out there and get in trouble. I just got promoted to my dream position by him so I definitely don’t want to risk it. I know someone who taught her 5 year old to tell people "you're making me very angry".   Yup. That worked out really well. [SERIOUS] Just for us parents that are going to have to give some sort of advice on this topic, what would you folks suggest?  I hate that shit, "just ignore them" "tell them it hurts your feelings"My advice would be to hit them with a flute. Sounds weird, but I got into a better high school that way. Also, you don't make your hands dirty.Holistic people are the most fun, aren't they?

"This leaf from Tanzania will cure your life-threatening disease, *and* it's all natural!"There comes a point where ignorance is dangerous. You sister immediately reached that point when she hugged you when she thought she may have had bronchitis. 

My cousin once posted something about having a measles party like they used to have for chicken pox to immunize his children. I went fucking postal on him and told him if he ever did that and then brought his kids around mine there would be hell to pay. Ignorance can literally kill. Stupidity kills.Brain zap?Same.  On the other hand, financing it was surprisingly easy!   Today, no way.My dad said he knew something was up when he bought a 1.7 million dollar house and they did not ask how much money he made....I am so sorry your mom is such a selfish bitch. Wow.My husband and I dated for 4 years.

 We got married and three months later we got pregnant. 

My mom offered to abort my child. 

Her exact words were, "I'll pay for the procedure". 

She didn't like me and she didn't like my husband. 

That was her reasoning.

My younger sister got pregnant from some guy she met at the club.

 Mom paid for a shotgun wedding for her.Remind her of this every year on your sons birthday. If she really is that selfish she deserves it.should've aborted your mom then and there>it's free money

Wait people actually think this...?Sounds like all my coworkers that eat out for lunch every day. “Prawph, why don’t you ever have any money?” Uhhhh, I actually work 2 jobs(sort of) and all of my income from that job is totally disposable. I simply dispose it straight into debt rather than fast food and cars I cannot actually afford. Very nearly out of debt though. It’s been a tough year but will be totally worth while when that last bit of debt is gone.  My family spends 1000 on paying credit cards a month. 
Most of them are store cards that they don’t use, so my parents are going to cancel those soon, but still.

EDIT: wow this blew up. Thanks!Some DOD contractor in Japan killed a Japanese woman there.  He went to the Marines, honorably discharged, and never sought mental health for the voices and suggestions he heard.  https://www.stripes.com/gadson-should-not-be-allowed-to-live-victim-s-parents-say-as-trial-continues-1.498305That’s terrible! Firstly it’s supposed to be confidential. Secondly that discourages people from seeking help if they need it. So irresponsible of the powers that be.That's the completely fucked up thing about the military. It took me the better part of a decade after I EASed to be comfortable with the idea of talking to a mental health professional. The attitude that seeking help means you're broken and cannot be trusted is so fucking toxic and unbelievably false. 

I often wonder how many of the Marines I served with that couldn't deal with what they had experienced would still be alive if we had a mature and healthy attitude towards mental health care in the military. Is your friend named Reddit?i've had the same problems in my last few relationships too, but not from a friend. just my own over analyzing everything. my current girlfriend is really great at explaining things to me about relationships and has really opened my eyes as to how i may not have been so innocent in those past relationships. 

some reddit haters will say many crazy and negative things about this idea, but the serious perspective shift has been a huge benefit to me. My boyfriends 'friend' was the same way when we first got together. My boyfriend was very insecure and had major trust issues. He'd freak out if I slept too long because his friend would say shit like 'oh I bet she went out last night after you went to sleep' 'she probs went to a party' shit like that. One time I woke up to a bunch of messages asking where I am and what I'm doing. I sent my SO a selfie in bed, eyes still closed half asleep. My SO told me later that his friend took one look at the picture and said 'nah that's not her bed bro' mind you his friend had never stepped foot in my house. 

SO got rid of the toxic friend and AMAZINGLY his trust issues went away (for the most part.) This had to be a ploy, even if it was something as base as to keep you from exploring your real alternatives.My advice would be to divorce the kid before you get caught.This is hilarious. Sounds familiar! My dad was a bricklayer and his dad was a fabric cutter- I got constant complaining every day about ‘wasting time at school like a posh c**t’ ever since I was 16 and decided to do A-levels. When I left for university he told me I wouldn’t last a month.

I start practicing medicine as a doctor next summer, and he still calls me to tell me all the lads I knew on the council estate have married and had kids and have their own cars. 

Yes, dad, I know I’d have my own van by now if I was a plumber. No, dad, I know there’s nothing wrong with being in the trades or the forces, it’s just not for me.Same here. Both parents worked dead end retail jobs and just couldn't stand the idea that I wanted to go to college and have a better life. They kept telling me college was a waste of time. My dad refused to pay for any college. I worked and went to a community college. Quit to get married to a man who wasted his time in college. /s Been married over 20 years. I've gone back recently and will graduate this December. > elementary school drop out

the fuck?

can dude even spell his name?Your final sentence is my favorite.

Your mom was literally nuts. Nurses not only save lives and do incredible work, they make bank. Hardly "throwing your life away."Well done! 
I can relate, in my last few months of university my nanna kept begging me to drop out. She left school when she was 13 and has been a cleaner most of her life. She wanted me out in the workforce earning more money too. 

Some people are always going to be ignorant and uneducated. I'm glad you chose your own path :)There are different kinds of life insurance. Some people really have issues with whole life, and say it's a bad investment. 

Either way, thank goodness your dad stuck with his plan. I'm so sorry for your loss, and hope you're doing ok.  Some insurance is a waste. Some life insurances are downright borderline scams. Being over insured is a financial mistake as well as being under insured. 


Should I insurance my life? "Will the loss of my income/unpaid labor/absence severely negatively impact my survivors?"

Should I insure an object? "Do I have to have it and can't afford to replace it?"


Should I insure my assets/future income (liability insurance)? "Yes!!"Apparently there are people that fall asleep just by lying down in bed or something? I am not one of those people. It's very frustrating when the doctor you speak to is one of those people.I'm told it's just mental. I should try harder to go to sleep.        
Nothing is quite as relaxing as trying harder.That's.... Not... How... That... Works...hahahhha, raising kids is a lot easier when you have money and less bills, also when you actually want kids. Lol my dad tries to guilt trip me all the time using this. No man, the one person who's always been there for me is my best friend. You're just upset your kids don't love you. I literally just got excommunicated from my batshit family about 12 hours ago. Right there with ya buddy. Hopefully that will be the best thing that ever happened to you. Or at least pretty good. I hope a lot better things happenIt doesn't have to be your biological family. 

I was in a similar position to you many years ago. Two Christmases ago my biological family ended up stabbing each other with kitchen utensils and one came out with a black eye. Thankfully I spent that Christmas around my 'true' family - close friends who I know I'll be friends with still when we're old.

I hope it works out for you in the end.Out of everything this has to be the funniest one here, especially if you apply it to weirdly specific stuff. 

"I think I want to do something with cars."
"Have you ever heard of Toyota?"
Then she wrote Toyota on a piece of paper and slid it across the table and that was my career interview over. *I think I would like to work in film.*

"Hollywood, have you ever heard of Hollywood? Litterally every film is made in Hollywood. You should go to Hollywood. Hollywood." If this happened in 1975, it'd be a pretty good tip....^I'm ^^gonna ^^^guess ^^^^it ^^^^^wasn't ^^^^^^1975Hahahaha
This one takes the cake for me.

All the career advisors I've had have been pretty bad.An older teacher once asked me what I was going to college for after high school. I told her I was interested in computer science and she said, "Don't waste your time. It's not going anywhere." This was 2010.It always amazes me that people with shitty jobs like “careers advisor” are the ones giving advice to kids about how to be successful. I told my high school guidance counselor that I wanted to be an anthropologist, she said I should go to college out west because "that's where all the dinosaur bones are" Harass the woman you want with unwanted, over the top romantic gestures until she falls in love with you.The part that bugs me the most is how they always make the current boyfriend/girlfriend is always horrible. Most of the time they don't even do anything wrong, they just arn't making their SO the center of their universe. no girls def like I when you stalk them across a country and spy on them through their windows.  I saw it in something about mary(Wonder Woman spoilers ahead, for anyone who hasn't yet seen it)

At the end of Wonder Woman, when Chris Pine's character flies a WW2 plane full of deadly gas to a high altitude and blows it up, sacrificing himself, my girlfriend at the time turned to me and said "You never do anything like that for me". Matilda?my grandma hated that i read so much too. she would stop me from reading and make me watch tv at night...once when i was 11 she called my mom to tell her reading so much was making me depressed and unsociable and it would probably stop me from knowing how to make friends, and that my mom should put a stop to it. in front of me. i forgive her though because she only had a 3rd grade education. She really said that? My elders had to force me to readDrop out of school for a fucking car? Who are these people? Where do they live? I want to go there and glare at them.My mom was the same way.

I dropped out of college for a bit after getting my car, a few medical bills, and some other debt. I just dropped out to pay off my bills since I couldn't afford it working part time at McDonald's.

After I paid everything off my mom said, "great you paid off your car, you can go get another one."

I explained to her nothing is wrong with my car, why would I need another one? And she was like, "but then what will you do with your current car?" Oh idk? Drive it? 

She still doesn't get it, and right now I'm about to graduate and she still complains that I didn't get another car. As my mom put it, "you will always have a car payment. Once you pay off your car you must get another one, if you don't you risk your credit forever." 

Idk where she heard that from.I  mean in general that's terrible advice, obviously. What bothers me is the chicken factory would be yourgotoPeople tell me all the time to buy a new car; I drive a 2000 white (beat up) grand marquis. But I've never had a car payment in my life and its reliable. Children are hella expensiveIt's like saying don't eat food when you're hungry because someone somewhere is starving"Well, stop being happy. There are others that are happier."This hit home way too hard. When i was feeling down it seemed like no matter who i talked to, that was almost always the response I'd get.Dear god. There are no words... did you see it?This is a bad advice when given to kids, because they don't understand the meaning of "ignore".

An adult that is already emotionally developed and has his life figured out, can afford to just walk away if someone's bullying them like kids do. Say, if a loser start telling you shit in the street, you just shrug it off because you're more successful than him, why even bother?

But a kid does not have that maturity. To them, everything the bully says/does, they take it as truth, and it makes them doubt themselves.What's the good advice for this scenario?  My kid has an older kid teasing him, stupid shit like annoying name-calling, but I can tell my kid is upset by it.  As a dad, my initial thought is to punch the older kid in the face, but you know, laws, so I'm not sure what to tell him or how to deal with it, cause my wife tells him to just say "no thank you" or tell on him, which isn't working apparently What the hell is wrong with your coworker? I mean that made my nipples hurt just thinking about itIt sounds like she doesn’t understand credit at all!College can kind of be scary when it comes to people's opinions and suggestions about drinking. I didn't really drink at all in high school so I didn't know my tolerance or limits when I got to college. People would be trying to get me black out drunk and shit. I'm all for a good time, but binge drinking is risky. I haven't made any friends and I've ruined my own life just fine, *thank* *you* *very* *much*.Several people advised a 6yo kid to jump off high places to fly? Who the fuck did you live around, a crack-house?Are you the blur that just flashed by my window??it really depends on what it is.  I got a degree in audio video and have had all sorts of odd jobs.  def weigh your optionsThis works if you're a morning person. Afternoon classes were hell for me, but I loved having 8's.I'm a bigger fan of 'cram your Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays' now you've got a 4-day weekend every week!Also introduce yourself first.I hate this advice. I’ve been depressed for years and subsequently am hardly passionate about anything. I barely have the motivation to even look for new things to get excited about. To be honest I don’t know if I’ll ever find a job I enjoy because I don’t enjoy much of anything."oh just do what you love the money will follow!" Bitch.. I can't make money eating mcnuggets.
Edit: I take it back. Everyone is now telling me ways to make money eating mcnuggets. Your mother was likely told this growing up and it’s the only thing she knows to say in this situation. She probably doesn’t even realize it either. "Prom is the happiest night of your life, why wouldn't you go?!?!"for some people, life peaks in high school. everyone is different but i'm 30 and i don't even think my best years have happened yet. High school is just, for most, where you're closest to being a developed adult, with the least amount of responsibility. In that sense, it's the "best". But with the hormones, lack of freedom to do what you want, self-consciousness, etc. I wouldn't go back being a teenager even if you paid me. Had a friend do this. She found a 'godly husband' alright. Three rehab stints later, years of physical/emotional/verbal abuse, and numerous threats, she is just now finding the strength to divorce him.It's funny how selective parents' memories get when you get older. They never seem to remember anything they did wrong.[deleted]In high school, I had a couple girls who I had never met tell me I should kill myself because some of their friends started hanging out with me. I think I'll just ignore that Facebook message. Not just the internet, every time I turn my Xbox on to play Call of Duty some kid keeps telling me he fucked my mom and that I am of African-american descent. I masturbated for years and no money came."it's not addictive">You may find a sub for anything you can imagine

More like Rabbit Hole...I don't understand this. A marriage is a complex relationship with two moving parts. How does adding a third, even more complex component suppose to repair the machine?As someone who also has eczema and ran out of the cream my doc gave me a couple weeks ago, my god I want to hit them for you.Should go back and take his job. *Restraining order intensifies*I read this somewhere and liked it: “You can fight for someone who loves you, but you can’t fight for someone to love you.” this is exactly my thought process. sure i could have bought at $5, but would i really have held on to it until $7k? probably notThat's actually good advice. Puts things into perspective.Learning a language from scratch in a country that speaks mostly that language might indeed force you to learn it fast, but it also sounds incredibly stressful and unpleasant. Think I'll pass lol. >...you learn a language crazy fast when you need it everyday.

Some people do. Language is like everything else we learn. There are people who can pick up a language rather quickly just by being immersed in it and those who have to sweat blood to learn every new word.

It's like math, physics or writing. If it comes naturally to you, you'll never understand why others struggle so much.  Yeah but this is generally very good advice for people going over as an ALT or hoping to get a job in software engineering as it's a) pretty difficult coming from a Western country to learn and b) most people coming over won't fit in and get culture shock when they're not immediately fluent.

I'm glad you got it right but it's not exactly bad advice when I've seen so many examples to the contrary and I would heavily advise against it to this day.My brother didn't go to college--instead he became certified to be a welder and makes roughly $120,000 per year now.

I went to college, have a degree, and do you want to know how much I make per year?

$24,000.im glad you didnt take that awful advice.
I was told this about a dog I had once. A dog is not the same as a child obviously, but this spirited dog saved my life due to her independance and courageousness.Oh God, "Rent money is dead money. You buy a house as soon as you can and then you buy another and let someone else pay for it".

Not the best advice I ever had drummed into my head, given I'm Aussie and our housing bubble is insane... This is actually great advice.  If I'd completely decked my bully in the 5th grade and laid him out, the next 7 years of school would have gone so much better.  Of course back then you just got suspended for 3 days.  Now you get arrested.Have you tried being happier?That may be but I'd rather be miserable on a yacht in the south pacific than miserable at work in the north west of the UKMoney itself doesn't buy you happiness, but a lack of it for your lifestyle needs and choices that you are at, causes a hell of a lot of unhappiness. But do so in steps. Otherwise, you get bad results.it should be rephrased to "be your best self"

keep your good "things" but when you feel that you have something to improve on just go and make the change

Can't get sick if you're dead. Great advice for mass genocideI saw elsewhere on this thread if you need more money you can get a second job at McDonald's. Good luck!You can do it in The Sims. Just walk in, give the manager a confident smile and firm handshake, ask him for a job as an organ donor, and work hard and play chess in your spare time until you're a world renowned surgeon."Stop talking, you won't be a cunt then, Mom."Ohh, have you gotten the wonderful, “You won’t be a lesbian after you have sex with me,” one from a guy you turn down yet?

Now excuse me as I seek medical help for the sprained eyes from rolling them so hard....with more work.Top 10 questions science still can't answerHad an old teacher with no family say he was racking up all the debt he could so he could have fun before he dies.My husband and I were working on getting out of debt, and staying in my father-in-law's run down house while we were working on it, for free.

We had a couple of credit cards north of 25% interest, so we went to the bank.  We said "we're trying to get out of debt, can you help us out with the interest rate?"

Bank of America;  Do you have a home that you can take equity from?

Us:  No, we're living rent free in our parent's house.

BofA:  OK, here's what you should do.  Buy a house.  Then, pay on the mortgage for about 5 years, then you'll have equity you can borrow to consolidate your credit card debt at a low interest rate!

Us:...............but right now, even with the crazy interest rates, we're scheduled to be out in 2 years.

BofA:  I still would *strongly* recommend buying a house.

This was fucking 2010.  It's like they had learned nothing.  We've been entirely debt free for 4 years now and it's the best thing that's ever happened.
Thanks for this. I've been thinking there was some secret I couldn't work out for getting started. A lot of people have no idea they do this.  Seriously.  They are totally unaware and ignore every piece of mail.  This happened to a woman I know.  She owed 10k on a credit card and first got sued in 2011.  She makes close to $40 an hour.  She could have just paid the damn bill and it would have been out of her life but it is 2017 and that shit is still following her around.  Pay your bills - it is far more relaxing than defaulting.  by the way im taking donations at the end of class, just throw whatever you have in the basketI think it worked for Kevin Smith and nobody else in the history of film.Indeed. The problem is that the one guy who actually sells his movie and makes back his borrowed money gets famous -- and the thousand people who sink into bankruptcy don't.

My own (good) advice is this: financial freedom equals creative freedom. I've been a writer for twenty years, and the only reason I've been able to keep pursuing this crazy business through the lean times is that my wife and I have always lived within our means.
"Women have the impulse to have as healthy children as possible, that's why I set your wife up with the fit pool boy."I had a student turn in an argumentative essay that included the claim that a man is entitled to a "piece of strange" when he wants it. 

Since I'm at a community college, I asked if he was arguing for open relationships and asked if this applied to female SOs. Nope!  Student remained very surprised by the negative responses from his peer feedback group and refused to budge on the idea that women should remain faithful and monogamous but men had a god given right to bang as many women as they could. We ALL go through a phase of being disowned.My brother’s girlfriend is like that. She doesn’t have a problem with gays, and her brother has said that he’s Bi, but she still insists that bisexuality is only a phase. She’s 24.I called and they hung up on me I often wonder how much someone like that would pay to go back in time and spend a day in their younger body with their young family. $10,000? $100,000? $1 million? Priceless? And yet they feel it's ok to continually ask you to give those days up for work.Work to live.

Her mindset on most issues was difficult to explain. Hey! I just found out that there are hot singles in my area who just want to fuck!My co-worker was bragging that he fed his month old nephew chicken wings under the table and how he was going to be the 'cool' uncle. After trying and failing to convey to him how utterly dangerous and stupid that was, my whole office was so distraught for the rest of the day. R.I.P. those baby buttholes Two children... left?I used to know a woman who fed ground beef to her 3 month old. That kid was crazy fat and always had stomach problems. He actually had a prescription for Zantac at the age of 3 months.It **specifically** says on cartons of almond milk that it is NOT TO BE USED AS INFANT FORMULA (at least - it does in Canada).

That poor baby :(In 5 years she’ll be blaming vaccines for her child’s learning disabilities.I hope you reported them because, bad news, this actually killed a child in 2014.

I asked the guy if he had seen it before and he told me that.  I bet there's a correlation between suicidal thoughts and having your own mother mock you for your acne.I've been using hand soap in the shower the last couple of days because I'm lazy piece of shit and after I ran out of body wash but I decided not to care. My skin is bone dry as a result.My brother took Accutane, and when he went to fill his prescription, the pharmacist asked how it was working. He was annoyed that his skin was dry and itchy going into winter (since it was no longer dumping oil 24/7), and it made his stomach hurt when he took it. So in an unfortunate choice of phrasing, he said "it's working, but the side effects make me want to kill myself." He had to backpedal really quick on that.You remember the dead baby cartoon on the back of each and every pill punch pack?honestly, find them and update them, theyre probably wondering how it wentMy guidance counselor said that with my grades, I didn’t need to take the SAT to get into college. Turns out you do. Glad I found out in time to catch the last offering of the test.The hard and fast rule for any human relationship ever is that *any* bullshit you accept early on in that relationship sets you up to get even more bullshit in the future. Guaranteed.Write a letter and put everyones signature under it. If they're really going to fire a dozen people because of such a thing, it's probably better not to work there in the first place.Obviously you have to add “You wouldn’t like me when I’m angry” for that to work.  I know someone whose mother taught them to express their feelings without filter, because doing otherwise wouldn't be "real". Forget being tactful. Her kids now tell her, without filter, their opinions of her. 

She thinks they're assholes now.There's going to be no one-size solution because there's no one-size bully.  Sometimes the bully is picking on people because they're insecure, sometimes it's lashing out because they're getting abused at home, sometimes it's a cry for attention, sometimes they're predators and like to pick on the weak, and the list goes on and on.

If a bully is being victimized at home, telling the bully's parents to punish the bully is going to be counter-productive.  Really the school / social services should step in to make sure the kid gets the help he needs.

If the bully is insecure, having the school or teachers come down on him may exacerbate the isolation they feel, and the victim punching back may force them to move onto another weaker target to save face, or it may cause them to double down on re-establishing their dominance.

Really, the thing that a parent has to remember is: Believe your Kid.  You're there as their ally.  Don't make them feel ashamed and weak for being bullied.  Talk with your kid to understand as much of the situation as you can, then talk with the teachers and school administration about the situation.  There's a non-zero percent chance your kid may be a liar and actually instigating problems.  

Then, follow up both with the school and with your kid.  Simply having the teacher give the bully a lecture or some demerits doesn't alter behavior.  If possible, try to help your kid come up with alternatives that can allow them to exist safely but confidently.Seconded. Everyone is making jokes and critisizing, but I'm genuinely curious what the appropriate solution is. I'm not a parent but this was what mine delt with the situation for me. First go to the teacher, report the bullying behavior toward your kid, establishing a paper trail. If that don't resolve the problem, go to the principal. Meanwhile my dad taught me  how to deescalate the bullying. (Your joke isn't funny. I'm not gonna do what you want me to do and need to get going.  Don't you have better things to do? etc.) Lastly my dad told me "if you are cornered and can't escape, fight back. If they have bigger fist, use your teeth, your nails, your keys... All you need to do is giving them wounds and draw blood.") I encountered that kind of situation twice in the middle school, and both worked wonders as I gave one of the guys a nasty infection in the hand (I bit his fingers and won't let go until someone pulled me away). I was bruised pretty badly from the fight and got in a bit of trouble with the school administration, but the bully almost never bothered me again. Although that earned me a pretty bad rep in the school because of my tactics of using my mouth in the fight. I later transferred to a private school and luckily there's no more bullies in there. I hoped it helps.My dad's bully solution:

"Tell them to stop.  If they don't, report them to a teacher.  If the teacher doesn't stop it, report them to the vice principal.  If the vice principal doesn't stop it then report them to the principal.  If the principal doesn't stop it then you've established a good paper trail of non violent attempts to stop your harassment and when it happens again hit them with something really heavy."

I got all the way to the final step.  Surprisingly, I wasn't bullied anymore after hitting Marvin over the skull with a telescoping projector stand.I seriously don't understand why you would ever say shit like that to your own child. Like, do you *want* to have your kid scarred for life? Do you *want* to pay for expensive therapy and counselling?It's a banjo, you hit someone with a banjo and they go down.So is cyanide, you ever tried that?

I will never forget the horrific brain zaps. Brain zoop 👉😎👉My Realtor was trying to get me to buy even more expensive houses. I barely afforded the one I had and was underwater at some points (losing the entire 20% down payment). Imagine if I'd have bought a 15% more expensive house with a 5% down payment. I'm sure they would have let me, and both I and the bank would have been screwed.During menopause my mom thought my sister was having sex with her dad,  and smeared cat food all inside his truck (he hates cat food smell).

My parents never went to college and my mom was a fast food worker now for almost 35 years. My dad has been working the same bank job but was jumping for one bank job to another when I was a child. Mom and dad wanted me to go to college because they said they didn't want me worrying about losing a job and have something secure so you don't have worry... this is insane.Well it depends on the generation. My grandfather, born 1931, dropped out in 6th grade. He said he came home one day and said ma, I am dropping out to help dad on the boat(Netting fish). It wasn't because he necessarily wanted to, but knew they were in a bad way with little help. Just a different point of view. it's more common than anyone wants to admit. In the 60s-80s we didn't have agencies that enforced truancy at anywhere near the level we do today. Especially in less progressive states at the time nobody really cared if you were a garbage parent who let their kid drop out in third grade. 

My mother quit in third grade and nobody cared. People really underestimate how absolutely fucking terrible previous generations were at parenting because no one was around to threaten them into fucking doing it.

The threat of CPS has completely changed parenting in the US> Should I insurance my life? "Will the loss of my income/unpaid labor severely negatively impact my survivors?"

My sister also received some stellar advice from the same school, she wanted to be a doctor and the advisor asked if she meant nurse.

Edit: A lot of people have asked, yes she did become a doctor.I never thought of this but it's really funny Some people are quite good at this. They're usually paid career advisors though, instead of randomly employed at a high school.
But there's a lot of jobs that people don't know exist and it takes some skill to help a 17 year old with barely any knowledge about themselves find something they might like. 

It's not that much of a shitty job if you're good at it.

A kid also may not have the freedom to walk away as their bully is likely to be a classmate or neighbor. They are stuck in the same space as their bully on a daily basis with no way to relocate. Moreover they literally can't walk away at school. You can look for another job, you can walk away on the street, you can threaten to leave your job to kick management into gear but you can't do that in school.I can only speak from personal experience.

I couldn't fight back physically, I was too scared.  So I ended up developing a pretty good sense of humor as I grew older.  At some point, I learned that if a bully made fun of me or said something I shouldn't take it personally and laugh it off; or even worse for them, laugh with them about me.  Maybe even crack a joke or two on top of their joke.  This just killed their game.  I no longer was a thing they could make feel bad with jokes, they hated the idea that it made me laugh when they made jokes.  Stopped getting bullied after that, guess it's hard to make fun of someone who enjoys it. No not entirely lol it does explain some of her money issues though This was Glastonbury Festival, my mother was a stall holder there so me and my sister generally went off to do our own thing. People are dicks. Thankfully there wasn't very many places a 6 year old could climb there. No, that was a 7 year old batman, I was taught to pass my knowledge to others.... I was not a morning person but loved 8 am classes because if I went my day was done early, and if I blew it off, the "I should go guilt" was gone even earlier lol. I mean prom was fun but i wouldn't say it's anywhere near the best night of my life and I'm only 21. I would say so far the best nights of my life have been all my friends 21st bday parties because we all get together (which doesn't happen very often anymore) and do stupid stuff and have funI genuinely don't understand the fascination some people have with high school. I remember reading an article about a genius kid who skipped high school and got into college. Someone in the comment section suggested the kid should return to high school and stick it out for the amazing experience of prom, even if they are bored to tears of the academics. :/ > for some people, life peaks in high school.

Super-happy I wasn't one of those people.High school was more stressful for me than College and significantly less than being an adult (although i'm sure that will change when i get a family).

Seriously, when i started working in high school, my days were basically:

1) Wake up at 5:30 AM (since i had to get a ride from my dad on his way to work)

2) do whatever until school starts at 8:00

3) 8 hours of school

4) immediately go home, get ready for work at a miserable food service job 2-3 times a week

5) work miserable job for 4-5 hours

6) get home, shower, have to immediately get to bed since i need to wake up so early

Days i didn't have to work, i spent catching up on homework. I also had to work one weekend day so, free time wise, i got about a day and a half per week.

In college I got several days of vacation time, but i was still busy. People go on spring break?  I work that week for 40 hours.  I didn't really have a vacation.

As an adult?  3 weeks of vacation. don't have to worry about work, don't have to worry about responsibilities.  Just me.  If i want to go vacation to Oregon?  Then there's a week. if that new video game i've been waiting for comes out? sure, why not take off some time for that?   My work is also, while harder, a lot less stressful than working food service.

I don't think i've peaked yet, but god, my high school responsibilities were a lot more draining than what came after

Thank you!Also helps if your eyes and veins begin to glow green and start bulging> the bully is picking on people because they're insecure, sometimes it's lashing out because they're getting abused at home, sometimes it's a cry for attention, sometimes they're predators and like to pick on the weak, and the list goes on and on.

I'd like to add that it's not always malicious and can sometimes be innocent, especially at young ages.

I did a brief stint as a bully in like first grade. I saw a movie or tv show or something where some kid made two kids bump their foreheads together. So like if two people were sitting close to each other looking at something while facing each other, you put your hands on the back of each of their heads and bump them together. It doesn't take much effort and doesn't hurt much. But stupid first grade me thought it was painless, just silly and funny. I want to say I did it to other kids for about a week. Then one day someone did it to me, and it hurt. I instantly realized I had been an asshole to everyone and I suddenly hated myself and felt a lot of guilt about what I had been doing.

My point is that at young ages, kids might not even realize they are being bullies.From my experience, make sure your kid knows that while you won't tolerate them instigating a fight, if they're being bullied and they fight back, you'll have their back. Life's not fair and schools will punish you for defending yourself, but that's a lot less traumatic if you have support at home. Conversely, if your kid is smaller or has older bullies, you have to go to what authorities you can- it sucks. I think it's because some people assume all kids are about as complex as the shit tv shows they make them watch and don't treat them like they're little humans growing into the people they will become. Many of which will be assholes.In fact, it prevents all diseases! One pill and you'll never have to be sick again! 


(Although you'll die so please don't be popping cyanide) When this happened to me, I thought it was all in my head. It would just be a slight zap randomly. Like, "Did I just get an electric shock down my arm?" I didn't know how to describe it, but it felt like being glitched for a second.  I finally told my friend how I was getting weird feelings, and he asked about my anti-depressants. I stopped taking them because I thought I didn't need it anymore. Once he said "brain zap," I was so relieved that it was a real thing, and not just in my head.

Edit:  in my head == my imagination Same here but for Paxil - "there are no harmful side effects" - yeah, as long as you don't ever want to climax during sex and stay on that shit for life.

There's an above?!One of the most interesting things about society to me now that I am in the real world is that there are 10s of thousands of extremely successful legitimately insane people.  The money covers it up, but holy shit there are some crazies out here.

Edit: woah, gold, pretty good for something I wrote on the toilet.I worked as a middle-management supervisor over a department with approximately 400 employees. I reported to one of the Senior VPs. Every time I met with him and showed him the productivity numbers, he said the same thing, "Our employees are lazy and unmotivated. You have to find a way to motivate them."

After hearing this umpteen times, I drafted a memo with color charts that showed that our people were paid approximately 20% less than the same positions at other companies.

I said, "You know what motivates people? Money."

VP looked at me and said, "No. Fear motivates people. Start firing these motherfuckers and replace them with new workers who make half as much. Then they'll work." He then gave me a list of employees to start laying off.

Next month, productivity went way down. Costs dropped but not as dramatically.

VP lost his shit. 

I patiently explained to him that (a) productivity goes down when you fire all the experienced workers who know what they're doing and (b) workers who make half as much require training because they have no experience. Training costs money.

VP then accused me of "sabotaging" the division.

That's when I quit.Just have the kid sign a post-nuptial. Same thought, I couldn't imagine my own parents getting jealous of me for being successful.Yeah, my mom raised 4 kids by herself working any job she could find. She wanted us to go to college so we didn't have to go through what she did. Yep.  My grandfather born in 1929 finished 8th grade because his parents wanted to make sure he had an education before he dropped out to work on the farm.  When he was in the hospital a few years ago, a nurse found out that he'd only finished 8th grade, and was kind of condescending and asking if he knew how to read.  His response was "Oh my God, you didn't learn to read until 9th grade?!"My husband is like this; as soon as he's relaxed he's out. Me?

Edit: The numbers thing has been explained many times now, please no more! Thank you!This basically also happened to my sister in 2010. She was told to not become a doctor because she wouldn't be able to stay home with her kids. She's now doctor so fuck them.


Edit for people asking questions: sister graduated high school in 2009 (I made a mistake the advice would have been given 2009), with a BS in 2012, and from med school 2016. She's in her residency now. Neither her nor I have children. I don't know if she wants kids. Alas we aren't close and haven't talked in sometime. If she decides she does though she has plenty of time. 

Edit 2: for those wondering we grew up in a very small town in Utah. We aren't part of the major religion here so we both had to deal with that growing up. She got told that she shouldn't be a doctor because she's female and I got told not to be an engineer because girls don't have a basic understanding of math and are too emotional. We've also both been told that we'd live unfulfilled lives without having kids. I can't talk for my sister, but I don't want any. I love my job, my relationship, and hobbies and it'll be a long time (if ever) before I decide to add a kid to that mix.Especially when they do innuendos with actresses involved.

Moby WHAT?!?!i was depressed too and she was one of the first to pick up on it, but i dont think it was harry potters fault, lol. she was right about me being kinda introverted but i never had issues with friends really. but yeah shes a very crazy lady who is unfortunately very uneducated and that makes her difficult sometimes hahaAs funny as it sounds, I posted here that my dad gave me the worst advice ever.

That being said, he also gave me some great advice. We rode by the local chicken plant in the summer once when I was an early teen. The stench was pretty bad and he was driving slowly. I said "dang man speed up, it smells awful here!" To which he replied "You keep f'ing up in school and this is where you'll be every day, boy."

That sunk in pretty well lol"If I'm not constantly in debt, my credit will be ruined. Hmm... this definitely sounds like the sort of thing I don't need to verify"Not that all uncommon either. A lot of really small towns may have one factory that supports most of the work force. My dad lived in a town for a while that was like that, and it processed chicken for Tyson. It's also likely that the chicken you buy was processed by a meth-addled redneck that has no sense of hygiene. 

My town is predominantly boat factories. With a few other specialty factories around. Also fueled with meth. 

Edit: This was in a small town in Missouri back in the early nineties. Plant closed down a few years ago.Don't be horny, there are teenagers in Mormon families out there!Classic ToddI learned the art of the sarcastic comeback early on thanks to my bullies. One of my most triumphant moments was in 9th grade algebra class. I was at the back of the room an this asshat named Bill kept poking and prodding me and making fun of me. I reached my limit and flipped him off. Sensing a moment to try and get me in trouble, he very loudly said "Sundance, did you just flip me off?" I shot back "No, Bill, I was counting to one, what do *you* think?" The class erupted in laughter and Bill was deflated. I think the teacher knew who started the whole thing so I never got in trouble for it. >This was Glastonbury Festival

Well that explains it. 

> This was Glastonbury Festival, my mother was a stall holder there so me and my sister generally went off to do our own thing. 

I'm sure your mum is wonderful and would never have let anything bad happen to you. Still... a six-year-old (and sister?) left to wander alone at an open-air rock festival in a crowd of well over 100,000 strangers? I'm going to guess the cape thing wasn't even close to being the riskiest part of your upbringing. Got a video of my friend drinking toilet water out of a Dennys toilet at 1 am on his 21st birthday One of those people. Can confirm it feels bad.

Sorry, I am quite illiterate on the movie industry, especially indie movies. I always wondered how small budget movie can even be made unless its just hobbyist movies.

They are not shown in theaters and i personally have never seem dvds or online sale for these movies.Happened to me once.

"BACK UP! BACK UP!" *twitches*
"Just mind your business"This is what I've told my son over and over. Don't ever start a fight, but if someone hits you, you will NEVER be in trouble at home for defending yourself. When I was getting the crap beat out of me every day after school by 3 guys who were a year older and much bigger, my dad's ever-so-helpful advice was "Pick up a stick and hit 'em with it." He didn't mention what to do if there was no stick available. Thanks a fuckload, Dad.My people!!!! What does it mean if it happened before i started taking meds? Lots of card companies offer reduced promotional rates on balance transfers. Meaning you can take 5k from a 19%+ card and transfer it to another card and pay .99-1.99 percent interest. Usually for a 6 month window before it goes to old rates. I've used this time to make an aggressive payment schedule and pay off balances quickly.Even if the money doesn't cover it up, they're still out there working.

If you start a new row with a number followed by a dot, it starts counting up from 1.I sometimes have a really hard time understanding how people think this way. Like not even the misoginistic aspect, how does a person think its ok to straight up tell another person how to live thier life? As someone who was raised by a single mother who is a surgeon, fuck whoever said that. To be fair, large passages of that book do revolve around sperm...Huh. I heard that "boy" with a deep Alabama twang.My uncle did something similar. My freshman year of high school he took me to Wal Mart for no apparent reason. My local Wal Mart is really dodgy. He just walked me around the store, nudged me, pointed at a customer and said “Go to College.” Did this for over 30 minutes. 

The irony is there’s a strong probability with that kind of mindset she doesn’t even have good credit. Dont be tired, there are people with crippling insomnia!True, they probably honestly believed it'd work. It may have been the peak so far. That doesn't mean there aren't higher peaks down the road.They start at local film festivals, usually.

You also have to realize that small films are often resume builders.  Someone in the industry will realize that you're dealing with budget restrictions and will want to see how you cope with them.  If you make a much better project than expected given your budget, they might be willing to give you a larger budget to work with for your next one.And nobody replied "r\/evenwithcontext"!I know Eggger and that wasn't Eggger Congratulations, we just taught a little girl to abuse PCP.My grandfather's advice was to run away. Effective until they learn to surround you. My dad's advice was to fight back. Fight I could, but 12 guys is 12 guys and I'm not going to win that. But then my friend's dad, who by all accounts really wasn't that great of a dad, actually offered me some odd advice: wait for each of them to be alone, and beat the shit out of them. It didn't make the bullying stop but it made any of them reluctant to be the guy who started things with me that day. Not living in fear every god damn day saved my life.

Go figure, the best advice I'd get was from an alcoholic who barely gave a shit about his own kids.Thor powers. 

Or you're weak against ground types.Frank Abagnale?

Or did like... They think his story was a how-to manual?Have their legal guardian sign it for them.

All the easier if it's your child!Is that because you studied computersBut you can stop it by just putting a \ in front of the period.

2005\.> Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that sperm till I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself unwittingly squeezing my co-laborers' hands in it, mistaking their hands for the gentle globules. Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving feeling did this avocation beget; that at last I was continually squeezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes sentimentally; as much as to say, - Oh! my dear fellow beings, why should we longer cherish any social acerbities, or know the slightest ill-humor or envy! Come; let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves into each other; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness.

> Would that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever! For now, since by many prolonged, repeated experiences, I have perceived that in all cases man must eventually lower, or at least shift, his conceit of attainable felicity; not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy; but in the wife, the heart, the bed, the table, the saddle, the fire-side, the country; now that I have perceived all this, I am ready to squeeze case eternally. In thoughts of the visions of the night, I saw long rows of angels in paradise, each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti.Which is why she thinks it's so random and easy to ruin. I just went to a local film festival last weekend, where I saw some shorts. Some were compelling and well-done, some were not. But the varying quality showed that there are opportunities for creative filmmakers just starting out - creativity and good direction trumped budget at this level.Looked like he was wearing and Edgar suitIf you're gonna tell your kid to fight, you need to teach your kid how to fight. 

Edit: tactics is part of fighting. The art of war: in conflict there is no shame in fighting dirty. If you're out numbered, figure it out. Fighting also includes using spies and using hierarchy and social engineering and emotional harm etc. Don't be stupid. 
I assumed you were writing in base 2005 so I knew what you meant.  

*Edit:* I know 1 is still 1 in all bases. I know it's supposed to be 10 in base 2005. Please stop messaging me and commenting with that.just put sand in their pocketsYep, Dad’s helpful advice was “just kick their ass,” apparently forgetting that I was a scrawny little girl who played in the woods and my bullies were boys who weighed nearly double what i did.  

One of the shrubs at the grade school in my hometown still has a dent in it from where they tossed me into it nearly three decades ago.Pocket sand only works once, the next best thing is getting naked. Nobody wants to fight a naked guy.Not technically a parent but an older sister, so my little brother when he was around 7ish had a search history of naked women and such. And when my mother found out and confronted him he cried and was saying he just wanted to be like Jack from the titanic by drawing naked women and he had a few pages of his attempted drawingsI have told this story before--

this was before my son was on social media; he was 7 or 8, and he asked if he could have some "alone time" in the office. I looked at his search history:

"big boobs" (which turned up weird humongous photoshopped boobs) immediately followed by

"little boobs" and then

"hot grils" which turned up page after page of Weber grills.

He's 18 now and has no memory of this. My 7-year-old nephew is obsessed with the Canadian pop band "The Barenaked Ladies"

Which as you can imagine has led to my sister shouting, "I TOLD YOU, YOU CAN'T GOOGLE THAT!!!"  many times.

My favorite story related to this though, is when his school teacher got married, all the kids in the class were assigned to write her a piece of marriage advice. 
My nephew wrote, "Have Barenaked Ladies at your wedding!"
My sister made a pre-emptive call to the teacher's assistant on that one. 
"Please make sure she knows it's a band! *face palm*" My parents saw my search history of "bloody gir" from invader zim 

For whatever reason they saw "bloody girl" and grilled me about it (I was like 13?) And that's when I learned how to delete my search history. 

That's when the real fun began.I found my stepdaughter’s musical.ly account. She had a bunch of poor attempts at sexy belly dancing to various Evanescence songs. My friend told us about how he found his brother's search history:

Girl penis

Girl not have penis?

Why girl not have penis?

He was 10Saw my 12-yr old brothers search history once. Was literally "boobs butt and also vagina"Was at my friends place around the age of 10-12 when my parent called me home randomly. 

I run in the front door and both my parents are sitting in the living room and immediately ask me to spell the word ‘sex’ I do and then the tell me to send my brother over. 

Brother runs over, he’d be around 9-10, and doesn’t come back. 

Turns out he searched for ‘girls having sex’ but spelt it six. 

[deleted]Pictures of my daughter (11) posing quite harmlessly that went on to bum shots (wearing shorts).  

Someone pretending to be a 14yo girl asked her to do these shots for a modelling competition and sent similar shots so she knew how to pose.  She eventually stopped the conversation.  The pics came through to my iPad (linked devices)

Police got involved and also CEOP.  They originated from an account in South Africa so Interpol took over the case and we will probably never get an update.

Instagram never even bothered to respond to my report.I once found my sister trying to search "sexy boy penies"
She might have just missed an S, but I still find it hilariousHad a coworker bring in her kid during the summer so that she could run him to the local middle school for football practice when she took her break at 9. Since I was in training at the time, I was sitting with her at her desk and mine was not in use. To keep him occupied, I'd log into my computer and then she'd pull up youtube so he could watch the "Watch me Whip" song, because apparently kids will watch that shit for hours. 

Well, one day she goes over to check in on him and says in a confused voice "Who the heck is Ed Gein???"

So it turned out that it was still logged into my Youtube profile, where I had taken to watching documentaries about serial killers, and the kid had clicked on one of the recommended videos. 

Whoopsies.When I was 9 or 10 my buddy and I were on the family computer doing whatever 9 or 10 year olds do.   My friend told me to go to "prettygirls.com" (innocent enough) - except it directed us to a porn site called "teenfuckinglive" and we immediately panicked and closed to browser. My mom really chewed us out when she found it. I tried to tell her we were just looking for pretty girls but she wasn't having it. It was a long few weeks of computer-less punishment.

Edit: not to kill the fun but I am a woman and a tattoo artist/body piercer haha. thus the stabby username.Not super similar but related. My mom gave me and my sister diaries when we were about 14-15 and I instantly knew it was a trap and they would read it so I drew a monster truck and some stick figures doing Kung fu then left it. My sister instantly decided to write about the dude she fucked under the pier and how she had been smoking weed everyday and how much she hated my parents. I have never seen someone dig themselves a grave so deep so fast. They read them the minute we left for school in the morning. My kids are preteen I was on their computer one time and found a series of internet searches: 

kissing 

making out 

condomI don't know what it is, but I'm willing to bet it's something I disapprove of.  My 15 year old happily announces he "went viral," because his comment amassed 1.5K likes on reddit.
"What did you say?" I ask.
[pause] "...I forgot."
"What's your reddit name?"
"...I can't tell you."
"Then why did mention it??"When my twins were young, elementary school, they were looking up the Simpsons and accidentally came across cartoon Simpson's pornography. The computer was in the living room so I heard them giggling and turned to see two guilty little faces. So hard not to laugh and so disturbing! What a conversation...
The sight of Milhouse and Lisa is forever burned into my retinas.When he was little, my brother once wanted to help us find a cool new purse to order for my mom's birthday. He image searched "fun bags," and my parents had to answer a LOT of questions. Not social media but once caught both of my nieces playing an animated game online where the objective was to spank a cartoon butt with a paddle. Every time they'd "swing the paddle" at the butt, it would emit the sound of a woman moaning. They couldn't understand why the game was inappropriate and were laughing hysterically while playing. 

Edit: People have asked (or assumed) that it was a game called "Spank the Monkey". I'm not familiar with this game so I looked it up and nope, that wasn't it. No idea what the game was actually called but it was a bare, white woman's (albeit animated) ass and the "paddle" was an animated ping-pong paddle. Never thought I'd ever have to type such a sentence.

Edit 2: Nope, it wasn't an Elsa game. IIRC there wasn't a face or upper body visible in the game but pretty sure I had assumed it was a woman's butt because the butt was attached to shapely legs that ended in a pair of stilettos. The cartoon woman was completely bent over (on a table, I think). This incident happened about 5 (2012) years ago. For those inquiring, I most certainly didn't punish my nieces; I told my sister (their mother) later night and we had a good laugh. My 15-year old step bro-in-law used my wife’s laptop while he was visiting the house and forgot to clear the history. His google searches included: girls pussing, hot puss, pussy willows, boobs and pussing, pussing sex. 

Hmmm, now that I type this out I am wondering if he was just misspelling ‘pissing.’ That would make a little sense... albeit not comforting. Not a parent, but my cousin one time got onto the computer when he was 11 or 12 or so and searched for "naked 12 year old girls". I was there when his stepdad checked through the browser history, and needless to say he and my cousin had a chat about acceptable search terms.When I was like 12 my dad found Dragon Ball Z Hentai in my history searches and proceeded to look through all of the pages while I hid in the bathroom pretending to take a shit. I remember him yelling my name and having to mentally prepare to deny everything LMAO. I’m scared as shit to have kids and find their porn searches

Edit: Don’t know how to feel about my highest upvoted comment being about Hentai but i’ll take itNot a parent, but some of my students (7th and 8th grade) ask to add me on Instagram. The worst username I’ve come across is “bootywarrior13”

Edit: I don’t ever add them, and my account is private. I never give them my handle because I don’t want them to find me, but if they do, I decline the follow anyway. Usually the way I find out their instagram names is because they will often times want their peers to follow them, and so they will “promote” themselves by putting their username/handle on the board. I often joke though that I would add them on Facebook, to which I always get the reply “Facebook is for old people” so that’s fun!Not a parent, but the other day my twelve year old little brother posted a topless photo on instagram with the caption "FuckBoy"
Oh dear god reading this makes me realize how much my parents probably saw in my search history before I knew about incognito mode.She joined one of those Facebook groups. It was called "anything is a dildo if you are brave enough".That my 12 year old son searched for “pro study tips“. No joke. My son. Trying to study harder. Never a million years and lives would I have expected this.  I have two quick stories--

When I was a little girl, I wanted to play some Barbie games or look at girl stuff so I went to Girls.com. Went down stairs to my mom crying in order to rat myself out.

My little sister had something similar happen. She wanted to look at new bikes in order to decide what to ask Santa for. She went to Dicks.com hoping to see Dick's Sporting Goods. Instead she saw a lot of shlong.

Guess it runs in the family.Ok it should be my parents telling this story but here goes. So when I was a youngin and just exploring the internet I would usually just go on Disney Channel to play games but I wanted to find more sites with fun girly stuff on them. So of course I just went to "girls.com". WELL. That took me right to a porn site and my little self was like WHOOPS and closed it right away. Well apparently my dad had been looking at the browser history and noticed. So my dad is interrogating my two older brothers asking who was looking at porn and they of course said it wasn't them. My dad was persistent with trying to get them to confess until I come down the stairs and confess that it was me. My brothers had the biggest sigh of relief I went through my 13 year olds cousin iPad.

He had searched “cream pie”, “girls doing a cream pie” and “cream pie videos”.

After, searches for “apple pie”, “pizza pie”, “peach pie” and “raspberry pie” came up, presumably to disguise his actual aims.Not a parent but One time my mom made me really mad and my dad had to talk to me about how I googled 'how to kill my mom' and why it's wrong to think killing someone will get me ps2 games Not my kid but on Halloween I saw a post on my 17 year old cousin's snapchat that was a selfie captioned, (verbatim) "Any girls tryna come over here and suck on this spooky dick and get festive with some pumpkin spice lattes" I immediately face palmed then laughed my ass off for a solid 15 minutes.Not a parent, but when I was a kid I found an adult flash game website. I would go on it whenever I had the chance. Eventually my mom found out and she told my dad to talk to me about it. My dad and I got into the car and he started this serious talk about how “the internet is a very powerful tool...” I felt really guilty. Then he told me how to erase the browsing history.A guy on Instagram sent my 12 year old step-daughter and her friends dick pics. Not just once, but many times. The police are involved and he has been located in NYC but we have yet to hear anything back yet. Fucking disgusting.

Edit: The man is at least 30.Aunt of Reddit. I was trying to figure out my niece's age, but it was too late to call my mom and ask. I remembered she has an Instagram account, and I thought that might help me figure out how old she is. I looked her up. She has the standard tween Insta bio about what activities she likes and a list of like 15 of her BFFs, immediately followed by pondering (and I quote) "Mostly why do people hate me".

She's 12. She is definitely 12.A friend from work’s son goes to a fairly strict Catholic school. One day I was walking out to my car, and she was outside yelling on the phone and generally freaking out. I waited around, she usually has a lot of funny drama going on. She hangs up the phone, looks at me and starts hyperventilating and then laughs hysterically. I was like, girl what is going on? She said her son’s principal called she and her husband need to come to the school immediately, that her son will fill her in on the rest. She continues to tell me her son said he got caught looking at naked ladies on the internet, and the principal printed out his search history. He searched “boobie prawn” and “lady parts” during class. She was yelling at her husband on the phone, telling him about the situation, and all he had to say was, “we should have taught him how to delete the history.” That my son is an urban explorer. He's 14 and I saw some video of him and his friends sneaking into an old air force base and climbing to the top of an air hangar.9 year old son's Google history: 

"Do girls in England poo blood for a month?"


ಠ_ಠMy 15 year old dropping acid on Snapchat. So... Not just shitty choices, but we're raising a kid stupid enough that not only created video evidence (which was beyond dumb), but to keep it under "my story". Sigh.

Edit: words Can I do the inverse? My dad recently opened an Instagram account, and within 10 minutes of having it, managed to accidentally upload a screenshot of our wifi password to it. 

Like, I have no idea how he managed that. Even put a filter on it, for some reason. Hopped on my nephews tablet and proceeded to pull up the internet browser. Immediately I was staring at a screenshot of an overweight homeless looking Santa, knocking the cornhole out of a much younger Mrs. Clause. I immediately asked my nephew what kind of research he was doing with his Santa video and his face turned fire engine red and he scurried back to his room.Checked my 11 year old sons search history to find a number of interesting questions...

Do men grow vaginas?

Will my penis disappear when I'm 18?

Will I become a girl?

How do I save my penis?

I asked him about his search history a couple days later and he told me that some kids in his school told him that when boys turn 18 they turn into girls and lose their penis. Those bastards...Once I called my mom and asked her what a “penis”, pronounced, pen-iss instead of pee-nis, because I got an email asking me if I wanted a larger one

Edit: I am a female. Was 7 during the call.Kinda Close. 

So I have a 2-year-old and a 7-year-old. They both love to watch kids YouTube. Mostly these annoying "toy unwrapping videos." I don't know.

Anyhow, the other day I was working on my computer and they were playing Play-doh. My 2-year-old comes into the room and asks my wife (while I'm listening) "mommy! I made this!"

My wife: "oh! That's awesome!"

2-year-old: "do you like it? Let me know in the comments."

My wife and I: D. E. A. D. One time when my brother was, like, 7 or 8 we walked in on him searching "poop" on google images. He was definitely too young for anything sexual, and I think he was just bored and thought it would be funny. Was pretty weirdWell I have child-like parents.

Weirdest thing so far was having to sit down and have a talk with my mother about how some things on Facebook are not real. My extended family lives in Houston and during Hurricane Harvey my mother was driving my elderly relatives to hysteria by emailing them horribly photoshopped pictures of Houston landmarks submerged under 50 feet of water followed by "It's a biblical flood, the world is ending, the news is lying to you, you're going to die if you don't get in your car and try to drive out of town right now". I talked to my stepdad and made him give me her password so I can shut down her account during the next natural disaster.I recently discovered my 10 year old son has been looking up “sex.” But his computer has parental controls, so he was trying to look up sex on his Roblox game. Ooold friend of mine has a younger brother with some disabilities, mostly mental. When he lived at home with him, around the age of 16, my friend caught him whoomping his peen (don’t ask) to bondage/rapesim porn. He later made an account on a sort of fetish or swinger website, with a profile saying he was looking for someone to come to the family house and punish him. He used part of his tugboat money to pay for a taxi ride for a woman old enough to be his mother to come to their house for this and she actually showed up, but she arrived as their parents came home and they had to meet. He quickly tried to make up a story about housecleaning, but she was firm and direct with the explanation. From then on, he had absolutely no internet access, with his brother going so far as to remove connection ports/components from his computer to stop hotwiring of any kind.

These days, he lives in an adult care home where he still has absolutely no internet access; there was an incident in 2014 where he stole someones smartphone and locked himself in a closet, speeding through porn and trying to access his fetish site account until the battery died and he was lured back out with food.My brother, when he was 14. Glad it wasn't worse.

"girl and boy hold hand"

"girl and boy kiss"

"girl and boy kiss on bed a lot"

"sofia the first episdeo 12"

Not a parent but this happened with a person I knows kid.

He was printing out pornographic images and putting them in the elementary library books. He also photoshopped the librarians head onto a naked wo man and passed it around school and he would sexually harass her all the time telling her to suck his dick. He also started downloading dick pics to send to girls. He was 10 years old. He's in juvie now.My kids are too young for twitter or snapchat, but they love to watch Youtube. I started getting notifications a few months ago from people replying to "my" comments on conspiracy videos. Found out my son has a curiosity about flat earthers and doomsday preppers. 

ETA: Thanks for the suggestions other internet parents! A little clarification for those concerned my child may become or may already be a flat earther. (Not much worry about the prepping. I guess underground bunkers filled with MREs are more socially acceptable?) He isn't. He won't be. The attraction seems to be borne out of amazement at what people can convince themselves is true, not a desire to be like them. I was reading Helter Skelter under my blankets and trying to figure out the street Scientologists at his age, so I'm not alarmed at his curiosity. I am not a Manson family member, a Scientologist, or even a Baptist despite my mother's best efforts. I have faith he'll be just fine or better. He's an awesome person. Daughter was 6 at the time. She wad supposed to be asleep and I go to charge up her kindle and cant find it. Go to her room and quietly sneak in. I find her watching a video under a blanket. Its popular mechanics and how to build your own windmill. She had a mock model in the corner of the room she was working on. Definitely wasnt expecting that. When my son was 8, my wife was looking at his tablet and saw his comments on Youtube videos.  Quite a few comments along the line of "YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU DUMBSHIT MOTHER FUCKER BITCH."... and others with randomly strung together cuss words that normally wouldn't be used together. He would get called out by others for the random cussing and he would say "I'm only 8 and I can do what I want [CUSSWORD][OTHER CUSS WORD THAT DOESN'T GO WITH FIRST CUSSWORD]!"

When we brought it up, he knew they were bad words but was repeating other vulgar comments he saw from other comment trolls and didn't fully understand the harshness of his words.  Now his Youtube habits are much closer monitored and he hasn't done anything like that since.  Late to the party and maybe not exactly what OP asked for  but here goes...

My So was looking something up on YouTube at her sisters place and the search bar autofill defaulted to " Seksy girls with niples you can see thru ther tops". 

My SO's niece is 6, needless to say her parents were mortified and doubled down on the parental controls.
Edit: new link

These stupid "memes" my 13 year old created in response to his friend being expelled for a year. 

[new link](https://imgur.com/a/jNhBj)   https://imgur.com/a/jNhBj

My kid's prize? Also expelled for the year. Plus, a "terroristic threats" charge in his academic folder.  Not allowed to set foot on county school property or attend county virtual classes. 

Kid is almost honor roll, teachers love him and many friends. 

Don't try to be edgy kids. Especially if you plan to use your schools "summer fun" hashtag.

The absurd part is the punishment. My daughters are grown up now, but when one of them was around 14 or 15 I opened up her MySpace page. She was telling all these kids that her mother (that would be me) was a raging alcoholic. She was telling them how I was neglectful and I did t like her. 

At the time I was pregnant with twins, working full time and my husband was gone with the Marines a lot. I am not a drinker at all. 

Obviously we had a long talk. She was feeling g left out with all the excitement over the babies. Still though, it was pretty hurtful. It took me a long time to get over that. My younger brother thought that when you entered more searches, it would delete the ones before at some point. So I look on his iPad one day and see a search for boobs or sex, one of the two. The search after that was cheese. And then cheese cheese. And then cheese cheese cheese. And so on. So many cheeses.

Edit: whoa cheesus Christ! Thank you mysterious strangers for popping my gold cherry! When I was 11 my mom asked me one day about some google searches on the family computer, including “sexy Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders.” I blamed it on the babysitter and somehow convinced my brother to back me up. A couple years later I was caught searching “can I see a picture of a girl in a bikini” but I wasn’t able to blame it on anyone this time around. I’ve since discovered the incognito tab...Not my kid, but my nephew. He was diligent upon receiving his phone to get Facebook installed among with an account. 

Last year Halloween, I walked by him on his phone and glanced at a video of an explosion. Turns out - he liked a page of people blowing shit up. Not just any shit, but the actual shit that comes out of our asses. When confronted - he said he was shown from a friend who uploads videos on the page... Back in middle school my friend was staying the night and was using my laptop to look at his facebook and talk to his girlfriend. The next day his mom picked him up, and later that evening I got my laptop so I could add songs to my iPod. When I opened it, I was greeted by a chat window in fullscreen, and apparently they just got done video chatting, and the last words were

Him: I'm almost there my little elf. Here I go. 

Her: Wow Santa! That was huge! Almost like it was a volcano!

ಠ_ಠ 

I quickly closed that window, signed out of his stuff, and slid my laptop under my bed. I didn't want any part of what bodily fluids could have been on there. 

Edit: Should add in that both my friend and I were in middle school and were around age 13 or 14. My son has Autism, high functioning but still Autistic. He has been mainstream most of his schooling and in 5th grade one of the boys told the others how to search vagina and boobs on the computer. Well my son in all of autism glory was searching pagina not vagina and was only getting pics of leaves lmao. Poor kid. 
My step son is 7. Found a bunch of searches for:

Dominicans with no hands and feet. 
Dominicans with no heads. 
Dominican chests. 
Dominican torsos. 
Dominican legs. 
Dominicans in stores. 
Dominicans for sale. 
Silver Dominicans. 
Black Dominicans. 
White Dominicans. 

I was at a loss of how to bring it up to him. Thankfully, the next day we were in a clothing store and he asked me why Dominicans don't have hands or heads, then why there are so many different colored Dominicans. I remembered the internet searches and became a little upset. I told him to be quiet because what he was saying could be taken offensively by Dominican people. He then got frustrated and loudly said "Dominicans aren't people" as he pointed to a statue next to us. 

I breathed a sigh of relief and said "Mannequins".Found a search for "weight loss" on my then 12yo search. Bothered the hell outta me as I've always tried to instill good body image and she is by no means overweight, she was going through the "baby fat" stage. Started having conversations about the importance of being healthy and exercising but to be comfortable with the body we have. She has since stretched out but man I looked for signs of starving and bulimia. Her Mom was a bulimic and I didn't want her to repeat that. 

**Edit- So yes "baby fat" isn't a thing at 12 but I'm not really aware of what you'd call that stage where they haven't hit a growth spurt but are filling out. Sometimes its not fat, its skin preparing for a growth spurt- so anyways- my apologies-  I just think calling it fat at 12 isn't a good choice of words. 

**Edit 2- I don't think there is any problem with encouraging being in shape. I think the line is where it becomes an issue with eating disorders, obsession. There are things we have to accept won't change- we have to teach that that's ok too. When twitter became popular my son was about 5-6 yes old. He came up with a way to tweet vocally. Throughout the day he would say things like “Going to play with my trains. Tweet! Tweet!” And “bacon for breakfast. Tweet! Tweet!” I was sad when he stopped doing it. This was probably the early 2000s. Me and my buddy were off school for the summer and he would hang out my house. Occasionally we’d look at porn on the family computer. One day my dad comes home from work and comes downstairs and says “Hey! You guys missed the bus!” I’m like “uuuhhh... it’s summer. There’s no school”. My dad responds “the bang bus”. Mother of god... we forgot to close the fucking browser. Not exactly social media, plus my kids are pretty young, but we let them watch Youtube Kids and I saw them watching videos of marvel/disney/DC characters that were dressed a family and the spiderman mom was pregnant...A picture with a weed that said "crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit" with the caption "had a dope weekend" 


He's 9. Instagram privileges revoked fast after that Back before there was google there was a search engine called hotbot. Lots of porn sites liked to use meta-tags that  children would search for whatever reason. We had a computer room where all computers were in the same room so that we could monitor our children when they were on their computers. One time out of the blue I hear my approximately 10-year-old son say “how do I get this off my computer?” There is a naked lady spread eagle on his computer screen because he was searching for Star Wars. But my husband did not miss a beat he turned to my son and said “one day son you’ll be asking me how you get that onto your computer” 

Edit grammar My dad once caught me on one of the newgrounds NSFW games due to search history... I was 11. He called me back in and made me explain myself. Wasn’t a fun night. 

EDIT: you all just doubled my karma score basically love you all babes you’re beautiful on the inside and out. My little brother, 16, just got his first somewhat serious girlfriend. He's known her for about three months, they've been officially a thing for about three or four weeks. On one of my elder-brotherly snoops through his Facebook messenger account, I found that at some point within the three weeks they've been going out, they had a fucking professional couples photoshoot done. It honestly looked like the sort of photos that would announce an engagement. I've never experienced a feeling like what I did when I saw those pictures. I have 9 brothers, my parents never knew who to blame for questionable search historyMy 10 year old telling his friends he was grounded for the weekend because *I* (his mother) didn't believe him when he told me he opened up the freezer and the cat jumped and ate the donuts. His friends all taking his side and saying I was "giving him trouble, yo'".When he was 8 or nine - a google search for "Star Wars Virginias."

We got my young daughter a tablet last christmas. A couple of days later I went to look someth ing up, and the search bar history had one entry: **Is Santa Claus real?**Lmao when my friend was in elementary school he accidentally left his porn up in a window and his mom found it. It was titled "hot mother daughter 3some". My buddy was 10 and his parents still tease about it My wife is an internet cave woman but is one of the kindest, most innocent people on this planet.

I was away for a few days for work and I guess she was feeling a bit frisky.  So, naturally she fired up the laptop to look for some porn to help her out.  

A few days after I got home I found her Google search:  

Boobs.

I love my wife.Super late but I gotta share
My 15 year old got busted with the normal porn sites, however he had several searches for dick size predictor tests. The kind where it’s the measurement of your hand or whatever. So we tormented him by all of us taking the tests. Turns out I have the biggest dick in my house, also I’m his mother 😂I'm a parent, but my daughter is 1 lol, but my little cousin was Snappin dick pics when he was like 10.

ETA: No, my little cousin did not send me his dick pics. He only had certain numbers programmed into his phone. One was his babysitter's and one was a girl he had a crush on, and it was her mom's number (who was his 1st grade teacher previously) but I guess he didn't realize it was her mom's phone. Anyway he sent little 10 year old dick pics to his 16 year old babysitter and his 1st grade teacher asking them if they wanted to touch it. Obviously the teacher and the babysitter contacted my aunt and uncle. My uncle flew off the fucking handle. I have a 6-year-old boy and a 5-year-old girl who are pretty obsessed with youtube gamers. They narrate their play like they are performing for subscribers and my son actually figured out how to post videos to youtube. I did not find this out until they had posted a few already.

They had ridiculous titles where one of them had obviously just been using the next suggested word so it came out like, "The ghost of the wealthy, but if they didn't then deserve." and it would be a video of my foot while I was asleep on the couch and you'd hear one of them say, "Foot." and then giggle madly and then the video cuts out.

**Edit: Unfortunately, these videos have long been deleted. I'm not sure if there's some way to recover them, but I'll look into it if people are that interested.**

**Edit 2: No luck on the videos, they're gone for good. Sorry, all :( Here are the kids in Link & Linkle cosplay as a consolation prize:** https://imgur.com/a/ckqnkFunny how most of the answers talk about Google porn searches, when the question was about social media. Not complaining though, these are interesting to read! I also have a porn story. My cousin had downloaded a hentai collection onto a USB stick. Just some large .zip file containing random hentai pictures. Some of the pictures were pretty wild and had some hardcore fetishes. The dumbass got caught. His mom (his dad didn't give a shit) called my mom and that freaked my mom out. So she decided to have my dad (who couldn't care less) seize my computer and search everything. I was shitting bricks because I had all kinds of similarly weird porn there. Because my dad didn't care, he left my computer "accidentally" unattended over night, so I snuck into the storage room and wiped absolutely everything. Me and my dad have a silent agreement to never bring this up. When i was 16 i got caught sneaking out of the house. 
They never did find out i snuck out to have sex.

However, i was grounded a while year, mostly because they found all the naked pictures i had taken of myself and sent to my LDR boyfriend who lived in another state. 

They demanded the password for my laptop and searched the whole thing, my myspace, my xanga (oh no my age is showing), and saw all the embarrassing things i had wrote on them, 

All the internet history porn searches. 

The look on my dads face when he realized the tiny thumbnails of a naked girl were his daughter.  Many of them in very sexual poses. 

i have never been more embarrassed in my life. 

To this day i do not know why my mom had to call my father and stepmother over to go through my laptop. (Divorced).  Guess she didn’t think it’d be that bad. 

It was.  

Edit: fucking iPhone I’s. 

Edit2: holy shit! This is been my biggest ever comment! I’ve been sick all day, this has made me smile to know I’m not the only person who has been through this! Thanks everyone!When I was in 7th grade I wanted to change the desktop picture on our family computer. At the time it was one of the default mac backgrounds which was like a bunch of leaves with water drops on them. I liked the look of the water drops so I decided to google “wet things”, only to discover a series of vagina pics. Dad found the search history, he had a hard time believing my true intent. My youngest of 6 was really into WWE, (wrestling). I found "guy on guy" searches on his laptop. He was only 10 so I was mortified as to what he may have seen by accident. There was also the possibility that it was purposely for something else. I nonchalantly worked it into conversation. I had to get a little more detailed with what I was asking each time, as I was met with a blank stare. Finally he understood and half freaked at the thought. We managed to piece it together. Apparently the older neighbor boy was using my son's laptop to look up gay porn when he'd come over to visit while my son was playing video games on his Playstation. 4 years later, yep, the neighbor kid is gay......"not that there's anything wrong with that".Last night nephew is asking me to google pictures of things.  He has a figurine of a stormtrooper that's in some sort of brown suit so he asks me, "Auntie icommentingifs, look up 'dirty stormtrooper'!" I said sorry kid, no can do.  Just nope.Not me, but a friend of mine.  One night, they heard really loud farting noises, but they ignored it because they thought maybe someone was just having a strangely loud bowel movement.  The next morning as they go on the computer, they see that their daughter was looking up girls sh*tting in each other’s mouths.  They had to talk to their daughter about this, and that’s how they figured out their daughter was lesbian and had a weird poo fetish.Uncle of Reddit* my brother stumbled upon his oldest (8th grade) son’s YouTube/Google search history and saw an exorbitant number of results for that cartoon porn (I can’t remember if it’s Anime or Hentai). This brings back memories of when I discovered there was such thing as "search history" my mom was using my computer and in shock she asked me "what is this?" I look at the computer and see "hot guy masturbating" shortly after I was searching my name to see who comes up on google images... so pretty much there was no denying that I had searched that. You guessed it, I'm gay. At that time I completely denied it and I blamed it on a virus. LOL[deleted]Uncle here: my mom has raised my 16 year old niece for most of her life. As the mother of three sons, she’s ill-equipped to handle all the crazy drama teenage girls ooze. She called me concerned about said niece’s Internet browsing habits, e.g. “OMG she’s looking at porn, what do I do, can you talk to her, tell her it’s not ok” etc.

“Mom... I’ve got this”

Checked her browsing history on her phone, lots of general porn, nothing to be concerned about. Had her over one night so my wife and I could sit her down and explain there’s nothing wrong with a little porn, curiosity is fine, DONT FUCKING GET PREGNANT, clear your history, all that jazz.

TL;DR - had the porn talk with my niece, parents just don’t understand.Got a phone call from a tech school, asking for my then 7 year old son.  As mom,  I asked why she was calling my son, having explained his age. She explained he went online and filled out the application to enroll.  I spoke with the boy and he said he saw no point in continuing his elementary education when there was a tech school he could attend.  He wanted a job,  not school. He couldn't understand why he couldn't go to tech school and enter the workforce. I gave my little brother my crappy laptop and (he's 13) and our dad went through the search history and found A LOT of porn, plus some searches about how to report parents for abuse, hating parents, running away laws in his area, etc. He called me and said these were things I had googled (and he tried to scold me!) Haha, no sir, that's all from your 13 year old son that knows his family is fucked upIm not a parent, but in middle school, we made notecards for every science definition.  When i googled cleavage, i was scarredI always loved searching through my dad’s cds with games when I was 10-11, trying to find something exciting, and once I truly did, because I found a game that was highly pornographical. It was basically about a brothel on a spaceship or something, and you could fuck girls from first view in it (made as a mini-game like hit the right button at the right time, you know these) which I remember pretty well if you know what I mean. It also had some story but that didn’t interest me of course

He found out I have installed and played it, but he didn’t made me explain, he got everything. He just said “you’re too young yet” and took it and I’ve never seen it again

I actually wonder what it was nowI’m quite late but when my brother was five or six I walked in on him with Minecraft on one screen, porn on the other. He was doing a sculpture of the human body, with both breasts and a penis. My mother was somewhere between disappointed crying and hysterical laughter.This is my favorite thing I’ve seen on reddit today. The attempted drawings really solidified it as my fave!I awed out loud on this one. Does he still try to draw?As a 19 year old son who had a similar occurrence, he definitely remembers, he just wants to avoid further shame. Could we please give your nephew some props for having a great choice in music though? She needs to **wake up**OuchWell? What's the answer?I see he is a man of culture as well The also part.Suggested edit for him: “boobs butt and throw in a vagina or two”My nephew was more specific on his quest for "naked Katniss boobies " I regret taking him to see Hunger Games when he was 11.Solid no-nonsense coverage of all the bases.We got the internet (dial-up) when I was around 12ish and it didn't take long to stumble upon, and then purposefully seek out porn.

I found and printed a picture of a lady with a man's penis in her mouth that I really liked. After I had it* in my hands I realized I had messed up and couldn't* keep it. I didn't want to rip it up, but I didn't want to hide it in my room either, so I hid it under the rug by the back door. 

A week or two weeks go by. I get the idea to go looking at naked ladies again. Then my heart dropped into my stomach as I realized I had left my picture under that rug all that time. 

I raced over to where the rug was, flipped it back and - it was *gone.* 

I don't know if mom or dad found it or who they thought printed it but neither of them asked me about it, and nobody ever talked about it.    This happened to the 12 year old daughter of a friend of mine recently. She also happened across it much the same way, and reported it to police. They ended up having a huge investigation, involved with the FBI, and the guy has now been sentenced to jail. My friend's daughter was one of dozens he'd been soliciting. > Instagram never even bothered to respond to my report.

FBI/Interpol probably told them to leave the account up. Instagram is usually really fast to respond to reports. As a dude I get a ton of camsite bots following me and Instragram always responds within a couple days when I report them.I like how she searched boy penies just to make sure she didn't get girl penies And look how you turned out, Born2stab.

Edit: how I [feel](http://static.libsyn.com/p/assets/3/e/e/4/3ee4d89a278559ef/ARC_18.jpg) with all this karmaOof great way to make sure your kids never trust you again. Though with how you knew they'd go through them it sounds like trust didn't exist in the first place dang.I knew my mom read my diary, so I baited her. I was 12.  I wrote that I liked cocaine and proceeded to fill a sandwich baggie with some flour and hid it in a drawer. When she confronted me I was all, I KNEW you were snooping and that's flour! HA.  I stopped writing my diary after that.See, I just don't understand this approach to parenting. I always promised my sons (now 17 and 19) that I would always respect their privacy and that their bedrooms, dresser drawers, journals, etc, were theirs and off limits to snooping...by anybody, myself included. I've always felt it's extremely important for kids, especially in their teens, to have a place all to themselves that they can consider their 'sanctuary'. My parents showed me that respect and I always appreciated it, especially knowing most of my friends didn't have that. 

Over the years, as tempted as I was (and believe me, some days the temptation was almost more than I could bear) I can honestly say that I never once looked through any journals, read any notebooks or letters from girlfriends, or searched their rooms behind their backs. I think this is partly why they have trust in me and, when they've had personal problems, they've been able to come to talk to me. They were by NO means angels (a bit of pot smoking, etc, in high school) but I didn't need to break their trust or sense of privacy to figure that out. 

Edit: spellingMy Dad read my diary once and found out I'd been smoking weed, so in my next entry I said "Dad found out I'd been smoking weed, imagine if he knew about [sisters] coke habit".

He rung my mother in a complete flap, believing it was true.What happened to your sister?My dad read my diary and knew I let a boy sleep in my bed. We didn't have sex but I gave a very descriptive scene of sucking dick. Don't read your kids diaries. My mom got me a journal. "Write in it, it'll improve your writting and handwriting." A month later; "why haven't you written in your journal I got you for christmas?" 

HAI'm lucky I was the tech savvy kid and knew what clear history was...

at least it wasn't

hand holding


peck on the cheek


horsecock dildo lubeWhat are the odds that he read thisLikes? You need to be a better parent and make sure he uses correct terminology. This isn't some Facebook shit, it's Reddit and super serial and we have up votes. /sLooks like everything's coming up Milhouse! I'm sorry but Milhouse and Lisa is the least frightening pairing....

Edit: besides married couples 

Edit 2: my most upvoted comment is about Simpsons porn, my mother would be so proudSomeone's parents I knew from school rang mine up and said I had sent cartoon Simpson porn to their son... no fucking way had I done that but my mum flipped. I explained to my dad and they made me show them my email inbox and outbox. There was nothing. No idea why his parents wanted to blame me for catching their son looking at porn. When I was 8 or 9, I typed butt.com into the search bar, because I was with a friend and trying to be funny not thinking there could actually be a REAL website... yeah... we were shocked to see that it was a real website. With lots of naked ladies. We both ran screaming out the room and I wouldn’t go near the computer for days. So innocent, so cuteI could never be a parent because walking in on that scenario would crack me upomg... I just remembered I used to play a very similar game when I was a child... On my dad's laptop. He must've been mortified seeing his 8 year old daughter spanking buttsI think it's pussy but he's only heard it, never read or spelled it.I feel like hot puss would show Dr pimple popper or somethingHe’s fifteen and can’t spell? Where was this exactly?I did the same when I was 13. Makes me cringe and beg for death. Definitely on a list now"naked 18 year old girls" next time son.
knoc knoc

who dat?

FBI

oh shit waddupI did the same thing when i was in elementary school. Too young to really understand what i was doing or the implications of it. Also for some reason i thought i could search for girls in my class and the internet would somehow have that lol. I learned how to delete search history real young though haha.

Edit: Haha seriously this is going to be my most upvoted comment?My girls and 8 and 10 and so far we've seen "sucking boobies" and "scooby doo sex". It's great. Parenting is great. Send help. My English teacher had an Instagram where she posts what she wears everyday.

She posted a picture with a little boob showing and an Elderly man’s account posted “Work that Cleavage”. 

Obviously, I showed everyone. What an absurd user name. That kid really needs to act more mature. if my son did that i would just start calling him that all the time. within 3 minutes he would regret the post, guaranteed. Ugh. Doesn't he know its spelled fuccboi?Wait - he posted a topless photo of *himself* with that caption?I may just be twelve

but instagram needs my abs!

It’s me, fuckboy Troy
My parents never checked my computer. Probably because they didn’t want to know? 

Edit: I asked my dad and he told me he didn’t check because he didn’t like people going through his shit so he didn’t want to go through mine. Followed by if I were really doing anything bad my sister would tel him.  

Edit: I English good. r/wholesomecommentsI was the kid in class when the teacher left for a few minutes i would jump on Google and look up the cool math games.Funny thing is. http://www.Dicks.com actually takes you to Dicks Sporting Goods homepage now.I definitely went to cheaters.com looking for cheat codes for video games.

I did not find cheat codes.It's cool, I lost my childhood when I tried to type nick.com to go to the nickelodeon website back in the 90s as that was when they would advertise their website and tell you to go with adult supervision, I remember thinking I didnt need adult supervision as I was allowed to play games on the computer so I tried to go there, but being pretty young back then I spelled it nikc.com and well back then nikc.com used to be a porn site... I panicked and went to rat on myself, my dad was understanding, gave me a short lecture, and just said don't go there anymore. Looking back on it, whoever owned the domain nikc.com was kind of an asshole, there's no way I was the only child that stumbled upon it.You're a good sister I liked that magazine called Girls or something similar to thAt. I wanted to go to their online site so I just typed “girls.com” and yep, I feel as if this has happened to a lot of us lolHa, smart kid. I probably would've done the same thing.I used to google porn when I was a kid, I would google “what does a guys butt look like” followed by “what does a guns butt look like” 

Didn’t work, pretty sure that’s how my parents figured out I was gay. "Wait... what kind of cream pie are you talking about?"

"What kind of cream pie are YOU talking about?"I don't know why, but I can definitely see my kid self doing the same exact thing just for videogames Something similar happened to me. My mom was jokingly threatening to snitch on me to my dad about a new tattoo. I texted my friend "please help me kill my mom". Well I accidentally sent it to my mom rather than my friend. That was an awkward conversation to have with the parents after.If this was my kid, Id probably roast himThe next time you see something like this from him, take a screenshot, frame it, and give it to him as a gift for 

Christmas. I would love to see how that would play out.That reminds me of the guy that installed my TV back at my parent's. 

Basically I got my own TV at some point (I must have been around 13) and we had a craftsman come over anyway so my mother asked him to set it up. At some point during the installation a prompt asked whether to block adult channels or not. I was the only one in the room with him, and he glanced at me for a second and then selected "no". 

.. wherever you are, thank you.He did you good... important life lesson was tought that day. Look for her finsta. You'll be surprised what you find there.I've reread this comment like 3 times and I'm still not understanding it. Can someone explain?Frankly, this is probably one of the nicer ones in this thread.I always read these things and get bummed that I never had any fun places to go as a kid. I'm just surrounded by dirt. No woods, abandoned areas, Just dirt, bushes, and more dirt.Having read through this thread, your kid sounds alright.Urban exploring is awesome just make sure he knows to be safe some very popular urban exploration places are dangerous as fuck and depending on what city you’re in the people around these places can be too I’ve had a couple run ins with people while exploring abandoned places that I would not like to have againI'm 17. Tried "urban exploring" once this year, ended up with a trespassing charge...Only after a night out clubbing Are you in England? Because it's weirder if you aren't. One too many cheeky Nandos?Hi quick question what the fuckConfiscate it and BOOF that shitHigh school age guy here. I can say that this sort of things happens on social media way more than it should. At least in my area.  

I feel like people just don't care, since they know their friends on snapchat probably won't rat them out. 

I deleted my Snapchat a year or two ago, but last time I did use it, it also tells you if someone takes a screenshot of your stuff, which probably deters some people from using said video evidence. My middle aged uncle accidentally posted a picture of his erect penis to Facebook once. It took him about an hour to work out how to delete it. In the mean time there were a lot of apology statuses.

FAQ Edit: A lot of people saw it. My uncle is a Londoner and Londoners are very good at taking the piss. The image is burned into my brain. It was thick but kind of stubby. It did not look like a vulva. [deleted]Poor kid. But now you know what you must do when you see him. 

"HO HO HO!""Knocking the cornhole out of Mrs Claus"
This may be the finest sentence crafted by mankind.

Christmas really is the most wonderful time of the year Uh oh...how did your son reconcile this with the existence of adult men?How do I save my penis?

Fucking gold. Laughed out loud."Yes please. I'll take two, thank you."My little sister did the same thing a few years ago. She really was just left alone on an iPad and watched YouTube videos all day. This led her to say things like:

“Tell the people at home what it is!”
“Click the like button”
Etc.That is 

WowWas once a 7 year old, can confirm I would have thought it would be funny.Is this what all kids do?  Mine did this, but it was a string of stuff.


Started with "chickens"

Then "chicken coop" 

Then "chicken poop" 

Then "funny poops"

Then "elephant poop" (I guess bigger is funnier)

Then "Elephant pee"

At this point kid ends is in YouTube, and through a series of videos she ends up on "Japanese woman peeing on subway platform."


The internet is a strange place O_oIs it wrong that I feel really bad for this guy? Huh. Every group home I've worked at allows the residents to watch porn and the agencies have emphasized to me that they are adults and they are not only allowed, it is their human right to watch porn as long as it's legal (ie not underage) porn. One guy I work with was constantly downloading viruses from the stuff he was watching, but even then, they didn't restrict his access, they just got him an iPad so he didn't have to use the agency computer.What happens in episode 12??? I'm only on 8.Holy. Shit.

When I was 10, I was a Power Ranger. What the fuck.

EDIT: why the hell this got 1600+ uppyvotesWhat sort of comments and what age? This has the potential for hilarious.So that's where all the flat earthers are coming from!

Edit: in 4th grade, I thought the government was spying on us. Turns out my ridiculous theory was right.They should rename the Carolina Reaper the Doomsday Pepper. "We're a watermill house, damnit!" "How to: talk to your children about engineering"That's awesome!Those sneaky engineersThere’s nothing wrong with your son, he’s just a middle aged Indian man with broken English.Ay bab u veri seksy open boob show vegeneYikes, that's a lot of memes. Did he share those with a lot of people?He probably would've been better off without the JFK assassination one, and *maybe* the image of the principal's head on dat boi saying "this meme is dead" could've seemed threatening.

I'm curious about what the friend's "joke" was that got him suspended for a year in the first place.At least he's ironically using datboiMy kid just gone 10 days and a sheriffs report filed for emailing an Arnold swartzenegger kindergarten cop clip.  There was a gun, in the school, in the movie, so my kid must be a school shooter.  Still isn’t able to use technology at school.  Honor roll student, never in trouble for anything more than getting caught with his cell phone in his pocket.  I think this would have actually worked on certain devices tbf...Yo I'm fucking guilty of this one. Though my thought process was 'I'll just hide the dirty one inbetween all of this other stuff.'

>'cheese' 'cheese cheese' 'naked girl boobs' 'cheese cheese cheese'"Can I see a picture of a girl in a bikini" hahah, politely asking the search engineDamn that's some vanilla shit.How is he doing?“This is not the wood I was searching for.”I don't have autism and definitely thought it was "pagina" or "bagina" until around that age lmao


or I just learned I'm autisticOh yeah, the star of my favorite movie, Leaf: Pagina Dentata!> Dominicans for sale

Oh boy>  I told him to be quiet because what he was saying could be taken offensively by Dominican people.

if your child wasn't so curious he could have been scared for life. Imagine if he believed mannequins could hear and think and nobody mentioned or talked about it. How terrifying would that beHoly shit this is the best one I am Dominican and I'm laughing so hard right now, thank you for thatNot an internet search but I had a similar one at Christmas a couple years ago. I was in the Christmas decoration section at the store and there was a black family next to me, mom dad and I'm going to guess a 3 year old boy.  The boy turns to his dad and basically yrlls "Dad! Can we get a white man for Christmas?" I was now very interested in this conversation and the Dad basically reponded "What??!!??" Very confused. His son again yells "A white man!" and point at the shelf.  His Dad looks where he's pointing and laughs and says "No, no, no, son, that's a SNOW man."My niece when she was about 5 or 6 was the the bank with her mom.  She says "Mom I don't like phillipinos" and mom is like what? don't say that! "Well they are too spicy, I don't like them!" She was talking about jalapenos... ....Im concerned that even though that isnt what he meant to search, he may have found things that scar him forever.I have an 11 year old daughter who I’m going through the same thing with now.  It doesn’t help that both her mother and I are both overweight.  She has always been tall for her age and she’s at the transition phase between little girl and young lady.  Fingers crossed that I don’t mess her up too bad.DAD JOKE OF THE YEARDad joke of ages.I can't imagine watching adult videos with anybody else in the room. Isn't that a solo activity? 

I just remembered strip clubs are a thing, so maybe I'm just shy.I refuse to believe this. It's too perfect.Your dad is awesome.Just to let you know theres a lot of seriously fucked up videos featuring child friendly characters on YouTube, many of them are able to bypass filters by using certain keywords and they can even end up pn the youtube kids app - what you described sounds like it could be what im describing 


Edit: r/elsagate https://youtu.be/X_K-shDq-kMr/elsagateNo, don't let them near YouTube Kids. There's been a lot of fucked up things going on with that coming up in news articles, not safe for children. That video you mentioned is one of those things.I think that's a Kid Cudi reference tbfThat must have been awkwardAh newgrounds...those were the days. What did he expect you to explain? No kids going to have the awareness to say they are going through changes and interested in jerkin their little ding dong all day Fuck I think this one made me laugh the hardest, I don't even know why it's so hilarious but holy fuck.

Did you roast him for it?As a former cat owner myself I would have to seriously sit down and weigh both possibilities. I'm sure he was full of it, but I have seen cats do things that would require way more brain power than jumping and pulling a box open.How risqué!!Somehow from your description of her, I can imagine her scrolling through the search results, giggling to herself.As a 33 year old male, I tried to put myself in your son's shoes. I could feel my head shrink into my neck. Wait, wait, hold the damn phone... What??About a month ago my 5 year old snapped a dick pic with the iPad and showed my mother. [deleted]>had obviously just been using the next suggested word so it came out like, "The ghost of the wealthy, but if they didn't then deserve."   
      
they are just making art that is so abstract it goes right over your head Finally some insight into the origins of /r/DeepIntoYouTube content. honestly I hope you left those up


that's goldI'd smash that subscribe buttonThey'll be incredible shitposters. And unknowingly, these two children supplied the internet with memes for the next month. Wow, how do you know about the new 'The Ghost of the Wealthy, But If They Didn't Then Deserve' game??? It's all every gamer is talking about. You thought it was your foot, but that's just how good the graphics are.lol that's amazingWhen I was 13-14 I took a picture of myself in my underwear. I didn't send it to anyone, I just liked how my body was looking. I had boobs! 

Put it on the computer, contemplated it, moved on in life. I was out with my mom weeks later when all of a sudden I got the heaviest sense of dread. Got home, and yup, dad found the undies pic. 

Few things more mortifying than your father seeing something like that. Luckily my mom tried to ease the situation by explaining I was growing and being curious was natural, but he still forbid use of the digital camera after that. I'm mortified even remembering this. I can feel the embarrassment that kid must've been so scared he forgot about incognito lmaoHow old was the daughter?Anime is normal Japanese animation, Hentia literally translates to pervert, and means characters drawn in the anime style having sex. 

Edit: and my most up voted comment by far was A a description of the difference between hentai and anime, and B due to reddit algorithm fuck ups. That is fucked up contact the police immediately. your mother should not have a say in that matter.  > DONT FUCKING GET PREGNANT

That's a thing I like. No "don't fucking have sex", but "don't fucking get pregnant".Your kid is my favourite kid in the whole wide world right now. Agreed, I'm 99% sure he remembers**S H E C A N ' T W A K E U P**Boolean operators are taught youngHa, similar thing happened to me s a kid, but I hid it under my mattress (Who would look there right?).  I came home from school and it was on my pillow.  

I thought oh shit I forgot to put it away and hid it again. 

Next day came home from school and it was on my pillow again.  My mom walked in and asked if there was any questions, or if I'm too embarassed she can get me some books.

My mom was not always very nice, but at least on this subject she was cool.
Hey I only stab with consent I love these comments because I never check the username until someone points out the surrealism.

Laughed my fucking balls off at this!Yeah that ended in like 5th gradeOh shit nice workBe grateful that it didn't end with you writing "TIFU by having the DEA called to my house".Yea parents who don't know the meaning of privacy are seriously the worst[deleted]> I just don't understand this approach to parenting

I think it's a mix of control issues and being paranoid that as a parent you have to stop your kids from doing anything even minutely stupid. 

I think that's why mom use to spy on me. But every time I got caught and punished for hiding things I wasn't supposed to do or have feelings I wasn't supposed to have, I just learned how to lie better and be more sneaky the next time. It's become a real bad habit where if I know something is going to cause a confrontation with someone I'd rather just keep it a secret.Well she was grounded and I wasn't so I didn't go home that day so while I was getting away with smoking weed and getting in trouble she probably got beat with a belt and I'm pretty sure my mom just cried all night and my dad got drunk and made a fire and burned the diary. Super healthy family relationship, no damage there at all. I can't wait to have "the talk" with my son. "We need to talk about how to be safe. Always clear your history and this is ad block... always double bag and run virus scan"Oscar: The lawyers are searching our hard drives for information on the leak. Thanks a lot, Big Brother.

Dwight: You're with Big Brother? Okay, go ahead. I got nothing to hide.

Kevin: Wait, are they searching all our computers?

Nick: Yeah. *(Kevin runs to his desk)* I already got to yours, Kevin. *(Kevin runs back)*

Kevin: No, that's cool. Sometimes...sometimes I run.

Probably in 8th grade. Yeahhhh it was not.A solid portion of parenting is learning to not laugh at that shit until after the kid’s asleep.I was in the hospital for a really large ovarian cyst once, and the nurse doing my intake paperwork asked me what kind of discharge I was having. I said “pussy” (meaning “resembling pus”), and he was like “Can’t write it like that on the form!” Everyone in the room had a good laugh.Or you made your parents on a list 

LolSame, eventually found out about nudism and made a whole bunch of prints and hid them under my bed.
Forgot them and found them again well into my twenties.
It felt like finding a live grenade.That was pretty much the gist of the conversation, with a little bit of "I could go to jail if anyone saw that" thrown in for good measure.Nothing about that is really wrong though. Finding people your own age attractive and wanting to look at them naked isn't bad. The problem comes from the way those pictures are made in the first place. Jinkies!> "scooby doo sex"

ruh-rohI see you, and I raise you a 7 year old boy searching for “LEGO boobs.”Do people normally learn about this stuff that early? I didn't know anything till I was 13>My English teacher had an Instagram...

I know this is going to sound stupid, but it makes me feel like an old Millennial when other adult Millennials talk about having had Instagram and Twitter in high school. 

Like, Facebook didn't become popular until my senior year. At that time, I was still putting div overlays on my MySpace page. 

Be the ‘cool’ parent who is hip with the current slang, especially when their friends are around.Immature kids these days...What a disgrace. Take your uncultured boipussy and get it out of my sight.He probably misunderstands it to mean a boy that girls want to fuck.Yeah my dad said if I'm gonna watch porn, hide it because nobody wants to know what you're watching. I was like 10 lol. > You don't have permission to access "http://www.dickssportinggoods.com/" on this server.

Well thenRisky click of the dayNo kidding. I know many a sister who would have counted that as a double win-- 1) for not getting caught, and (2) for getting her brothers in trouble.Same for whitehouse.com and writing fourth grade social science papersHAHA! I used to love the site gURL.com. It had games and stories. My best friend (we were 13) was babysitting and had access to their computer. I told her to check out the site. Unfortunately I forgot to mention the spelling. So of course, while babysitting, she went to girl.com-a porn site on their computer. 

Oh, and this was before we really knew about deleting browser history. They never called her again.“Porm. Porn. Prom. What to wear to prom. Biggest porn. Biggest prom ever” I used to google image search "bottom" followed by things like rock bottom, bottom of the list, or whatever the non-porn google search suggestions are to use for defense in case I was found out.Video games don't make kids violent but not enough video games makes them cold blooded killers.kinda fucked up either way.

Dad had no idea he existed until the kid was 7 and by that time his mom had done a lot of damage. He had so many behavioral issues and his dad tried as hard as he could. He fought the state to try to keep him out of juvie but couldn't as the kid just kept violating the terms of his probation or whatever kids are on.He's 10 so a lot of it was just calling people "derpy". Now if he is proving the motherfuckers wrong then it is double hilarious"In this house we OBEY THE LAWS OF THERMODYNAMICS!!!!!!"Got a call from a scammer the other day saying they can lower my cc interest rates.

It works somewhat, some devices only autofill based on the 3 last results in the letter category. If you search "nudes" then you need 3 searches with an N at first and a second letter that isnt U.

Luckily my parents bought me a puberty book that cleared up that confusion before any serious damage was done. A more realistic answer is he could have found one of those disgusting gore websites with searches like that, and that could really mess up a young mind. > It doesn’t help that both her mother and I are both overweight.

never too late to make a change! use her as motivationIf I could lend some friendly advice as a young girl that suffered an eating disorder who had overweight parents... the pounds and weight meant nothing to me. I still don't see them as fat or overweight. The self doubting and shaming thoughts I would hear my mom tell herself were so impactful though. Its one thing to compliment her and the way she looks, but her self image sparks from your own. 
Again, friendly advice. If a few words of mine might help prevent another young girl from going through what I did, then I must share.

In junior high my science teacher was a bit overweight and had *massive* boobs. As a boy, I of course found that fascinating (as did my friends). 

One day as a joke I wrote "Miss Robins Has Huge Boobs" on a piece of paper and passed it around to my friends so they could sign their names if they agreed. 

When I got home that afternoon, I went for a #2 and emptied out my pockets on the floor (including the folded up paper with all my friends' signatures). I was an idiot and forgot to pick it back up when I left the bathroom.

Later, I was in the living room reading a book when I noticed my mom and dad laughing hysterically. "Look, his friend Justin signed it *twice*!"

The world stopped. *Fuck*.

Walking into the kitchen to confront them about it, beet red, was one of the most humiliating moments of my childhood.My face is burning with secondhand embarrassment15 or 16 I don't quite rememberhttps://imgur.com/gallery/IW8simF**S A V E       H E R**Jesus what did they do to her after they read it, my parents would have killed meI feel the DEA would write a post.

Apparently she was worried I was gay.I relate to this too much. My parents meant well, but it’s tough for me to be emotionally open. Even as an adult, I don’t feel like I can confide or discuss my problems with them at all. You ok? I had a guy sell me his pc with all his passwords saved into chrome, allowing me to view them and what sites they are for, let's just say it was a bit interesting...You ever notice that the IT guy is the same guy that talks to Pam about graphic design in the job fair episode?Yeah that would hurt

Challenge acceptedr/TheyDidTheHeyWaitAMinuteWho came up with these website names? Yep especially if they are young enough that laughing at it makes them do it again for attention. My best friend and I got in a lot of trouble for laughing at her 2 year old sister when she bent over and took a shit on the hallway floor. We laughed even harder when her father ran through carrying her like an airplane rushing her to the toilet. When I was in the second grade I had a classmate who’s name was Peter Cockshott. It took me a while to figure out why my parents were laughing hysterically when I told them that. Lol I do medical transcription and the doctors actually dictate "pussy" sometimes.  Purulent is what goes on the report though :)They probably cross reference the list. 

"Well there was a couple of searches for what appears to be child porn. But considering they bought a computer around their sons 13th birthday we can safely only put one guy on the case." Just think of your legacy if you had died in a car accident or something and someone else found them. ... prints of what? When my brother was 14 or so my mom found his Playboy stash under his mattress. She taped notes into the center binding on each page with a nude.

Things like "This one seems a little fake to me. Love Mom" or "She's got a nice smile. Love Mom" or, my favorite, "She's not showing enough skin I think. Love Mom"

Bring Daphne and Shaggy but don't tell FredThe google searches are from the 10 year old who hit puberty last year. She's hormonally  a teen basically. The younger one just uses the word "nipples" as an exclamation and hollers about her bigger sister and "THE PUBERTY".

I was devoted to sneaking past parental computer security to find that sweet sweet porn by age 11, so maybe it runs in the family. I was definitely reading fanfiction porn and hentai at age 11. At ten years old I had already discovered how to have orgasms from the faucet.

We didn't have internet quite yet but my mom had a bunch of forbidden books hidden away that I found *fascinating*.Sometimes I wonder if this is the kind of parent that I want to be. Kids gonna look at porn. Might as well teach him/her about incognito so I can remain blissfully unaware. Then the brothers resent each other thinking the other is lying.

I don't know who Cody is, but your kid is 14. Make sure he knows as his hobby grows, to be safe. Live in Northamptonshire, it has spread to Kettering I can only imagine some sort of British TV show talking about menstration.

I got diagnosed as mildly autistic last year (at 19 years old, *smh*; dunno why it took so long to figure out), but I'm really mentally weird around the whole sex thing.

I usually don't mind touching, so I don't know whether this is an autism thing or a LarryWren thing.Don't because it's funny. He even laughs at it now. Same but it went the other way too. One time camping when I was 7 or 8 I told a campfire scary story about a monster with thousands of testicles.

I’m down 15 lbs over the last two monthsWell, you're no fun.tbh even some of this kid friednly stuff you gotta keep an eye on. For example my little guy loved this unboxing channel. Then the dad on the channel started streaming kids video games too. Oki cool. Now they are streaming games too scary for kids but its still marketed as a kids channel. Couldn't tell him not to watch it anymore (his biomom goes out of her way to defy or not allow anything we decide at out house) but I explained that he needs to ask for a grown up to watch those with him in case they get too scary and we need to take a laugh break (watch cats be silly)How does a spread eagle woman come up when he searched for star wars?[deleted]He though it was the funniest thing. We all had a good laugh [deleted]you didI had a very sexually related dream once that I decided to write down on paper. I had taken it out of my pocket and my mother found it.

That's their reward for not trusting you. They wanted to keep tabs on everything when you were under their roof and you had no choice, but now that you are free and have the choice, you choose not to share with them.Meh enoughI literally cannot understand anyone who would sell someone their device without it being completely cleared and reset as new.They recycle some actors, like michaels grandmother ends up playing Pam's great auntPeople who know that you’ll stumble upon it by accident. lol my parents are both educators so that would look really badUnderage girls posing nude on some european beach.Reminds me of that bit in Malcolm in the Middle where Lois puts pictures of her face over Reese's magazinesJeepers!Oh god not the puberty I think I'll just ignore it. They can hide it and think they're gonna be punished if I find it, but if I find it they'll never know about it. 

If I did walk in on them I'd just make some dad joke and pretend it didn't happen. maybe "accidentally" show them how to use incognito mode, tell them I don't want advertisers tracking me or whatever

I don't understand why you'd get angry...It was super sad because his dad tried so hard but by the time he got him and got custody of him it was too late. 

Dad was also really sick and in and out of the hospital so that didn't help and I'm sure added to the kids problem as he really had no stable home.Only 10 and he's already trolling. I was vulgar when I was 10. Derpy would not have been my first adjectiveYeah but just doing that should keep you in the clear most of the timeYes he is but Every one is different.

So much of the mess around my apartment was down to me leaving things out instead of taking the extra minute to put them away in their correct place.

I’m not perfect but it has helped!! I just read about a couple of studies where they had subjects do expressive writing about traumatic experiences. This is writing about their deepest feelings about these things, rather than the objective facts of what happened. And I recall one group only did this for 15 minutes of the day, and they found a boosted immunity and people taking more positive action. One group was a bunch of people laid off without warning and over half found jobs pretty quickly where only around 20% of the control group did.Dishes, do your goddamn dishes every day and you wont feel fucked up every 2 weeks with a pile of them.For us heavier people, quit drinking soda and walk half an hour a day. Watch what happens.

Man, I feel hypocritical just typing that.Not every day, but I've started making a habit of putting 100 bucks a month into my retirement account. Even though I'm pretty young and don't make much, at least I'm saving something Save a little bit of money that you'd otherwise spend on something you don't need.Live by the rule: if something takes 2 minutes or less to accomplish, just do it.

You’ll notice how many things are really not that bad, but also how much accomplishing things is just a mental block.Say something genuinely nice to a loved one, colleague and stranger.

It'll really make their day.Flossing; then you get to be a smug prick that flosses Try not to do anything in bed but sleep. Don't read, watch tv, browse reddit, etc... you'll start sleeping better.Put all your spare change in a jarTry to go to sleep at the same time everyday and wake up at the same time as wellDrink a glass of water each morning when you wake up.Take the stairs instead of the lift.Plan the next day before going to bed at night and write a 'to do list'.  The next day before repeating the process review your to-do list.  Sounds really simple, but it's a real procrastination buster.  keep your house clean, if you do it everyday it wont be a big task and a clean environment reduces stress.

EDIT: Also, start eating high fat low carb way, here is a [great keto cookbook](http://downloadketo.com/keto-cookbook1) to begin with.For me that would be learn 3 words in Spanish everyday. Started this a month ago and I am getting better! :)This was the best AskReddit I've read in a long timeExcercise for 30 minutes. Writing a diary. 

There are different ways to write a diary. You can write down every story, which you experienced during the day. Another option is to write a diary like a checklist, i.e. you have captions like "30 minutes of walking", "30 minutes of logical exercise", "30 minutes of reading the newspaper". If you walked for 30 minutes, you can fill in the checkbox for a given day. 

By doing so, you will always reflect your day and optimise your daily routine. Brush your damn teeth! Pro Tip: you only need to brush the ones you want to keep. Stop drinking sugary drinks. It's a small change really. Just replace your coke with water. Man... the weight loss was more than expected. Walk your dog. Stop just letting it go outside and come back in. Two walks a day, morning and night. The exercise is great for people just starting to get into the groove. Your dog will love it and you for spending more time with it. They'll also enjoy the fresh air and new smells. Plus, you've picked up a great health habit for two or more individuals. Being your boyfriend/girlfriend and/or kids. You'll gain new appreciations for wildlife, too. Get yourself some comfortable cross training shoes, too. I recommend serpentine Sketchers. Exercise mate.  Never stop. 

If you are fat now and have been for 20+ years, don't expect to see result for at least 3-6 mths depending on what you do and how you eat.. but, if you keep at it.

5 years down, you can either still be fat, or slim health and full of energy.Try to get rejected once a day.  
Not for anything in particular or even particularly important. You'll succeed less than you think.

For everyone asking about my tshirt, today it's a tan Element shirt with a graphic bamboo design back drop. "Stole" it from my brother at some point. It's kind of ugly and ripped up so I wear it to work.

Write in a journal.

It is cliche but it works. I used to do it, but when I felt like my life was on track I just stopped. It led to me falling into a lot of bad habits and being able to convince myself I was fine. Drinking, smoking, video games -- I fell into a mindless state that led to serious dissociation and memory issues.

But keeping a journal has a way of keeping you honest with yourself. You aren't writing for anyone else. You aren't trying to present your best self. You can just work through your thoughts honestly and openly. You can reflect in a way that you otherwise wouldn't. You can just let it all out without worrying what that exposure and vulnerability will mean. It really helps. I'd recommend this to everyone, especially people with anxiety.Following the words of fictional character Dwight Schrute:

"Whenever I'm about to do something, I think, "Would an idiot do that?" And if they would, I do not do that thing."

Craving a cigarette? Ask yourself the question.

***Edit: To the people commenting "Idiots also breathe, so should I stop breathing?":

An idiot would take reddit advice literally. 

An idiot would try to apply the said advice to their life without questioning the applicability of it or the rationale behind it. 

Also, an idiot would point out how they think that some types of advice are inapplicable to certain situations,  because they themselves are incapable of keeping in mind that not everything is to be taken literally. An idiot would then post on reddit about how a quote from a TV show is giving the message that people should cease ALL activities that idiots engage in, including breathing. 

An idiot would fail to comprehend that the meaning behind the TV quote is: 

"If a thing is objectively idiotic to do, don't do it." 

An idiot would misunderstand the meaing of the quote as:

"If the thing you want to do is something an idiot also would do, regardless of how necessary it is, do not under any circumstances do that thing even if not doing that thing could kill you. Because you have to seperate yourself from idiots by having absolutely no common activities with them." 
Practice on an instrumentLearning a language. Use a tool like [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) (free and has a mobile app), and just do 15 minutes or so every day when you wake up/before bed. I think if you stick with it and try to do at least one new lesson each day, you could easily finish an entire language course in a year. (I'm on day 563 of my streak, and have finished one course and am maybe 2/5 through another). 

The other day I was reading someone's book over their shoulder on a tube journey, and it wasn't until I was halfway through a page that I realised I had been reading Italian. It was super satisfying, and made me feel especially proud of the progress I've made since day 1. Situps and/or planking.

Yoga.Daily reading. Books are the most powerful medium for broadening your knowledge and changing how you think. Even fiction books can make you wiser than before especially through active reading.Be kind to someone less fortunate than you without an expectation of anything in return. Big or small, helping others is the most therapeutic and rewarding thing I do in life. Keeps me in check with humility and reality. Each day follow a different recipe from a cookbook or online. Plan your meals weekly and shop for the right ingredients in one shop. 

After a year you will be an amazing home cook. Taking a dump on works time. 10 min a day soon adds up!Meditation.Changing your posture. At first it will hurt, then it will still keep hurting. Please help it still hurtsI’ve seen many good small things, but I’m going to toss out an elaboration: incremental improvement, and a baseline task. 

The baseline task is something you have to do every day. Sick as a dog? Get it done. Groggy waking up? Too bad. Slept late and will be late for work? ...do it as soon as you get home! 

This can be anything. Making your bed, searching your room for clutter for 5-10 minutes, doing 30 minutes of yoga before work, etc. All it has to be is some small task, preferably at the start of the day that gets you up, thinking a little, and moving around. Set one alarm clock. Two for safety. Setting 10 only hurts you. 

I chose to do the yoga, and it pays dividends. I’m up earlier than I would be otherwise, and more alert. I have the time to make breakfast afterward. I can spend the first 30 minutes at work alertly setting up the day instead of docking around while I wake up. If I happen to miss that days “real exercise” (and to be clear, I definitely saw some weight loss/strength gain from the yoga after ~6 weeks) I don’t feel like it’s a total bust. 

From there, pick something else. Brush your teeth, twice, every day. Then pick up flossing. Then pick up using mouthwash. Maybe invest in a tongue brush. Make your bed. Go for a jog. Spend 30 minutes reading. Add one of these things every week or two, not all at once. Make one a habit, then build on it. 

Some days, you’ll be busy, or tired, or you’ll want to binge watch Netflix instead while eating Doritos. And that’s fine! Being a robot is a bad thing - you’ll find that on those days maybe you missed your jog, you ate out dinner instead of cooking, and you played video games instead of reading...but you still made your bed, still did yoga, and still took care of your oral hygiene. Good job! 

What I’d recommend that I’m sure you can find throughout the thread to add one thing every two weeks: 

1. Do yoga for 30 minutes right when you wake up. Every. Single. Day. 
2. Make your bed. As fancy as you want - I straighten the sheet and place my pillow properly.
3. Brush your teeth if you aren’t already. At night, then in the morning.
4. Floss at night
5. Use mouthwash (enamel-safe, anti-cavity whitening is best) after breakfast and before bed 
6. Go for a 30 minute to one hour bike ride every other day. Or a swim. I recommend these as they’re non-impact cardio sports; get into running once you have the diligence and cardiovascular endurance. 
7. Pick up some kind of 30 minute to one hour lifting routine to do 2-3 Times a week (I recommend starting strength or the reddit Recommended Routine).
8. Find a 10-minute chore to do, every day. You can watch Netflix while you do it. Vacuum the floor, get your clothes in the bin, wash those three dishes, etc.

Imagine where you’ll be in six months. You’ll have good hygiene, be more flexible, be in great shape, you’ll have a clean living space, and god knows what else you’ve done! 

Tl;Dr: Pick one good thing to do every day. Always do it. Pick another good thing to add next week. Repeat for three months, then hold onto them. Don’t get discouraged.

Edit: I've gotten a few people asking for links. 

The recommended routine can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine

Start trying for your toe now, you'll be putting knuckles on the ground in a month or two.   Really helps with circulation & posture.  Practice from a cursive chart found online, until you reach typing-like speeds, then integrate as many of the techniques and forms as you can into your printed handwriting. You don't need to know cursive these days, but you're not learning cursive (well, you are, obviously, but it's not the end goal), you're learning how to write quickly and fluidly, where and how to place extra lines for aesthetic reasons when needed, and where to start and end your strokes. If you're tired of your handwriting looking like a 6 year old's, which it has ever since you learned a combination of imitating Times New Roman and scrawling down your best impression of what your 1st grade teacher showed you, learn cursive. You may never use cursive again, but your printed handwriting will become Christmas card worthy, and 2-3x as fast.Cleanse, tone and moisturise.

I never wear makeup or used to use any skincare product and I would break out moderately all the time. My skin is very sensitive to everything and always gets itchy and irritated so I always stayed away from anything. Then I decided to look on Reddit and found Avene and slowly applied it more and more. Then I got into a routine and my skin is now 10x better. It’s not flawless but so much better and not as many breakouts. It makes a big difference.How you treat your body for 20-30 minutes a day will dramatically affect your life for a very long time. 

Work out, with weights, 3-4 times a week.  Do different areas of your body each day.  Do single reps, move on to another exercise for that area and then another different area. Do this for 3-4 reps per cycle. Today this is called High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT).

I joined the military in '68. I was a skinny wimp, just over 6' and 148lbs.  I 'learned' to work out every morning.  Except for some lazy spans (one for over 2 years), I get up at 5-6 am and workout. Either here at the house or at the gym.

I'm 6'2" (and shrinking) and 195lbs.  This morning, and most mornings, my blood pressure is 122/79, pulse 76.  My last blood test panel of over 25 tests all came back within the required ranges.

And no, I'm not a health nut. I ate really bad food as a kid.  When I was in my 20's. McDs was my staple diet.  Still go to fast food about once per week.

So exercise moderately but exercise.[removed]Meal prepping. 

I make my meals for the week in advance on Sunday. It saves money since you make less impulsive food purchases during the week. Plus it's easier for me to make healthy food choices since I've plotted it out for the week in advance. I hate waisting food so if I have lunch made I'm not tempted by pizza.

Plus, I weight my food since I'm dieting and it's so much easier to weight and log my food in advance rather than lug a food scale around or have to guess at quantities during the day. 

Also, I really like cooking but lack the energy during the week. So I get my cooking fix out of the way on Sunday's and all week don't worry about it. Plus, even though there are a lot of dishes on Sunday, during the week all I need to do is rinse out my food containers. 

If it seems intimidating, just start by making your lunches for the week in advance and work up from there! I have a sweet snack before shopping for groceries, that way my sweet tooth is sated. I buy less sugary food and am closing in on 100lbs lost and no longer need meds to control my type II diabetes.How small are we talking?

Read 30 minutes every day and that's 3.5 hours a week, enough to finish a book every two-four weeks. Depending on what you choose to read, that's 12-24 books completed.My dad recognized in me that I often avoided social gatherings/situations. He sat me down one day and said, "You can't always do what *you're comfortable with.* When you only do what you're comfortable with, you always end up in the same place. There's no room for progress."

Fast forward 15 years. I have a job that relies heavily on networking and social functions. Don't get me wrong - I still *hate* going to functions, and I still have to give myself a pep-talk before I go to them, but I go. And every time I do, I think about my Dad and that moment he showed me the way. 

this can be applied to daily activities: do one thing per day that is out of your comfort zone. Talk to a stranger (within reason), try a new activity, visit a new area, etc. It broadens your horizons. Chew your food. Digestion begins in the mouth with saliva, the more it breaks down before it goes in your stomach the faster it will be processed. Should say if you chew too much, you can make your jaw swore, but you would know if you are over doing it.

In February, add a handful of plain almonds each day. In March, add one extra glass of water, and so on. You won't feel deprived, and you will increase your healthy habits painlessly. Read a good book for 1 hour.Not sure if this is a small  habit but I started intermittent fasting this year and I only eat between 2pm and 10pm. I generally eat whatever I want but I make sure that I get a salad, lean protein, and half a gallon of water first. Also a big fan of chili. I have lost 25lbs over 2017 and didn't even feel like I was dieting at all. I wasn't fat before (just kinda chunky) but now I wear 32" jeans comfortably and can see my top 4 abs almost. Thank you, not sorry.  

I used to (and still do) have a problem with over-apologizing in basically every situation even when a serious apology isn't needed. When you get into this kind of habit, it may seem reactive to just apologize for everything you do to try to please other people. It can affect your confidence and also degrade the way other people view you. You become the person who's sorry for everything, and that's sad.  

So, I've tried to consciously use "thank you, not sorry" to change that. Every time I get into a situation or catch myself about to say I'm sorry for something (that really doesn't warrant a heartfelt apology), I look for a reason to say thank you instead.  Running late for work? Say "thanks for your patience" instead of "sorry I'm late." Not only does this keep you from looking like a sad sack for apologizing all the time, it actually shifts focus onto the person you're apologizing to. It turns into a positive rather than a negative. You're complimenting them even, letting them know that you value a trait (their patience) and that it's important to you that they were generous with that trait. I wish I had more/better examples, but I can't think of any off the top of my head. Skipping. 

Unlike other suggestions which require quite a bit of time, you can get away with a decent 10 minute skipping session (or longer if you have the time, ideally I'd say 15-20mins) do this daily, by the end of the year you'll be like "Whaaaaaaat!?"

It helps build new relationships in unexpected places. I’m a messy person.. always have been... not a hoarder but I definitely clutter stuff up.  I try to spend ten minutes every day just cleaning something up and that goes a long way towards not being embarrassed to have people over. If you drive somewhere, park as far away from the door as you can (within reason--an example would be the far back of a carpark at your local grocery store). The time spent walking to and from your car adds up, if you're not usually the kind to exercise.Making your bed!

**EDIT**: Everyone saying "you'll get mites/it's pointless/why make your bed if it gets messy anyway"

Since October I've been paying more attention to what I eat and how much I eat, on top of drinking plenty of water and hitting the gym regularly. I've dropped around 7-8 lbs since I started. It's not a ton, but improvement is improvement and I honestly feel so much better knowing that I'm capable of losing weight.

The bulk of the weight loss is because I've been a bit more careful of what I eat and drink. The exercise has really just helped tell my body "plz dont use muscles for energy they're trying hard, the fat's fine to burn."Hey! You don't have to be "heavier" for this! It's great advice. People typically consider me average build, even slim, but I can absolutely see and feel a difference when eating healthy and just walking around. Use the walks as a time to accomplish other things, such as call and catch up with family on the phone, do some mental processing on work tasks/ideas, etc. Bonus points for getting lost in thought and forgetting how long you've been moving.

And you're right, sometimes, honestly most of the time, getting shit done just comes down to making the conscious choice to get off your ass and do it. 

Don't compromise, no, "I'll do it later." Or, "if I wait till tomorrow, I'll do x AND y to make up for it" Don't barter and bargain with yourself, just get the fuck up and do what you have to.As a guy with ADHD, this would be my luck.

https://youtu.be/AbSehcT19u0The anticipation of doing and the consequences of not doing something you don't want to do is *almost always* worse than actually just doing that thing. Say nice things too often and it reduces the meaning people give your kind words, so be careful - I call this “affection inflation”. 

Compliment people just enough for each new compliment to still have value. 

Otherwise you’ll be dishing out the equivalent of Zimbabwean dollars in love. You’ll have to start blowing people just to equal the strong aloof head nod that someone with stronger love currency can trade with. 

EDIT:

There have been a lot of comments on the above analogy (which was mostly intended to be a humorous counterpoint to the parent comment) and many of these replies are from people saying there’s not enough happiness in the world / there should be no limit to kind words. Others disagree.

To continue on the currency analogy, we all want to live in a world where no one struggles to get by. Self-esteem poverty kills and a nice injection of love wealth keeps people above the poverty line.

A very popular person (love rich) gets a high five and barely thinks about it. Just some pocket change entering the love bank. A very unpopular person (love poor) will find these love coins much more life-changing though; it’s more noticeable as they’ve gone from having nothing to having something to hold onto, they can eat off it for weeks. You should regularly compliment people with low self-esteem - give to charity.

Now, we have celebrities with a very strong currency. If Daniel Radcliffe high fives you it’s worth more than your mate’s high five. Your mate’s high five is more available and therefore worth less. That’s not to say that your friend’s high five is worthless. If he gave it to the poor guy he’d love it. What I am saying is both your poor guy and your love rich guy are going to get a nice kick out of that Radcliffe high five, it’s just so so valuable it’s a significant windfall to both of them. 

That’s why it’s important to ensure your own currency has as high an exchange rate as possible. Unless you’re Daniel Radcliffe you should print those compliments only when they’re needed in order to keep their value high. That keeps your currency respected.

Put enough out to stimulate the love economy a bit and to support those in need of love finance assistance, sure, but it does your love poor person no favours to print out reichmarks like it’s 1918. Poor guy can’t even buy a loaf of self-esteem bread if you hyper-inflate your currency by telling him he’s such a good boyfriend and his dick looks big every time he enters a room; you’ll have to suck him off just to keep him from starving on how much he hates himself. 

You also want to keep your value high in case you ever need to trade with a love rich person (eg your boss), as otherwise you’ll only be able to give him a barrel of insultingly cheap brown-nose coins instead of a couple notes of a strong currency that rivals the robust Radcliffe dollar. 

Hope that satisfies everyone. Live well and stimulate your economies responsibly. Honestly the sense of satisfaction when you answer "yes" to the dentist about flossing daily after a lifetime of the guilty "no" is well worth it. 

Plus my mouth feels pretty decent now. I had a few friends round for retro gaming and pizza the other day. After pizza, one of them just started flossing out of nowhere. On my sofa. Wtf.The biggest deterrent to flossing seems like it's often the damn floss. Trying to hold it, getting the right length, shoving your fingers into your mouth. 

So buy a flosser. Any of the disposables (solid or interchangable heads) or the ones where you string them up yourself. Huge gamechanger and turns Flossing into a very simple 2-3 minute task you can do right before you brush.And that lacks in-between-teeth-funk. *Looks at comment while laying in bed*

I feel so disorganized and like I'm not as productive at work and I'm so behind on housework. It's crazy how just checking things off a list really makes you feel satisfied and encourages you to keep it up.This.

I'm a serial procrastinator, habitually late, and easily crippled by indecision.

But a while ago when my ex and I broke up (through things that had nothing to do with any of those things), I decided to hit the gym (as people do after break ups) and felt like going in the morning made the most sense.

So before I got to bed, I check the weather for the next day, review my calendar on what I'm doing the next day, and I pre-pack my gym bag with work clothes, and layout my gym clothes, as well as whatever lunch or breakfast I've pre-made, and go to bed. 

Then when I wake up the next morning, I get up and don't stop moving.

Get up, make coffee, *don't even turn the fucking tv on or open FB or Reddit*, shotgun a protein bar, toss on gym clothes and grab my gym bag and I'm out the door walking to the subway.

I really wake up while stretching at the gym and by the time the coffee and preworkout kicks in, I'm killing it. 

Hit the shower, walk another two blocks to work, and instead of walking in the door at 8:10am half asleep, I fucking kick the door to my office in at 7:50am with my brain firing on all cylinders and ready to kick ass and take names.

I'm in better shape and far more productive than I've ever been, *so long as I plan and plan and plan before going to bed*.

You know what's actually really good to practice this with? Stardew Valley. The way the game is set up so each "day" comprises about 15 real world minutes so you make a small checklist of what you can feasibly get done in 15 minutes.

Oh also if you have mental health issue's follow this guys advice. Try to get at least 1 thing done a day however small, could be showering or making a meal whatever. I grew up living in conditions you’d see on hoarders. It took me years of therapy and forcing myself into a routine to keep a clean house for my kids. I actually had to go to therapy about it, it’s kind of crazy when you think about it. 

My parents wouldn’t believe it if I told them I have made my bed every day for a year. 
I’ve been awful with this, and always too embarrassed to have company over.  Going two weeks now- 
-unload dishwasher before breakfast, load dirty dishes instantly thru day, start load and wipe down kitchen right before bed. My kitchen stays so clean!
-first thing when I get home, rotate between doing a load of laundry or vacuum, whether it’s needed or not.
-I have two "clutter" laundry baskets- one for everything that goes downstairs and one for everything that goes upstairs. Pick up all the clutter around house at end of day, and then just carry the baskets around putting stuff away really fast. 
-Saturday until noon is spent 
cleaning bathrooms and at-least-once-a-month chores like windows, dusting, mopping, etc. Then all weekend is carefree in a clean house.  It’s definitely made a huge difference in my well beingYeah I agree.

The free [Daylio](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.daylio) app is a great tool to do this in an easy quick way, and can you get daily reminders and historical stats! I've been using it for years and feel it really helps me think about how I spend my days.> Pro Tip: you only need to brush the ones you want to keep. 

Sweet!  Suck it, bicuspids!Not only does it help you lose weight, but you just feel better too. Sparkling water helps as a middle between soda and water.

edit: spellingAlso, I stopped drinking milk everyday and that made a huge difference as well. The weight loss was also more than expected. Water is great

Edit: I used the wrong weight :/Hardest thing about giving up soda was that I always drank soda with certain foods (i.e. burgers and fries, pizza), and now I always crave soda whenever I eat those foods. It just doesn’t taste the same with water. Wait some people don't walk their dogs?!
I'm thinking about getting a puppy in a little bit after I've learned what I need. I've been going on walks by myself to get used to taking a pup out every day... I thought it was just something that was needed, still do.

People, walk your damn dogs!Nice try, Sketchers and Big CanineOr just eat less. Takes way less effort. You dont even have to count calories or do any of that fancy shit. Just cut what you are normally eating by a third or a half and kick some of the most pointless calories like - soda.

Edit: Im not saying exercise isn't helpful, just that its hard to do if you are fat. I carried around some 40 extra kilos when I was fat - that is an exercise by itself. Id love to see how those gym rats would perform after a day spent with 40 kilos on their backs. It is exhausting. I was not fat because I had willpower and dedication, I was fat because I was lazy, demotivated fuck, so in my case it was best too keep it as simple and easy as possible. What can be more simple than eating 2 slices of pizza instead of 4? Also walking is nice.On the counterpoint, if you're someone that's super agreeable like i was irl, try practising saying no once a day[deleted]>Try to get rejected once a day.

I think this is pretty much the same as doing at least one thing that scares you/makes you uncomfortable everyday.  A simple mental trick to make it a habit to get out of the comfort zone more often.There’s a book called ‘Rejection Proof’ by Jia Jiang in which the author does a 100 days in a row of trying to ask for things that will get him rejected. His experiences turn out to be quite funny sometimes and it literally changes the course of his life. Yeah. I actually done this in my university days. Me and a mate would play '2 minute challenge' when we went out. In 2 minutes you need to find someone, and make out with them. If you got rejected, you were paying for drinks for the rest of the night.

At first I hated it and just conceded without trying. But then one time I was like fuck it, Succeeded way more than I thought I would, and it also wiped out my fear of rejection which was my main reason back then for not trying with girls, and many other things.

Stupid but it worked, gave my confidence a great boost

Simplified: The game goes like this;

2 minutes to find a girl, make conversation, then ask if she is interested in making out with you. If the answer is no, you pay for drinks for the remainder of the night, **not sexually assault a woman**. The fact I'm having to defend myself here is stupid lmao 

I’ve been trying to describe the funk I’ve been in for the last few years and that perfectly nails it. 
A mindless state of dissociation and memory issues. 

I️ feel like I’m just passing through, not actually experiencing anything. This is all fine and dandy if you aren't an idiot, what advice have you for idiots like me?

Edit: Ok, the Costanza is the most recommended tip, you can stop suggesting it now, I'm on it! Is mayonnaise an instrument?I picked up violin a few years ago, and already I've played a 
(tiny bit) at a friend's wedding and another friend also just asked me to play at her wedding heh.  Everyone asks me how I sound so good, and the answer really is just 1) finding an instrument that you love, and 2) playing it as often as you can.  Getting the first part right makes it an awful lot easier to get the second part down.Also if you’re interested in learning something other then a language khan academy is good for learning math and sciences, I’m currently trying to learn physics and trig.  
Also Memrise is good for killing time and learning at the same time. Shout out to us over at /r/languagelearning what a weird haiku.Two weeks ago I started doing yoga every day and I already feel so much better physically. I have a lot more energy!

To any beginners looking for a good place to start I recommend the Youtube channel "Yoga with Adriene". She does a 30 day yoga challenge that is perfect for people like me who have never really done much yoga. It's easy to follow and she slowly ramps up the difficulty. Books are real life cheat codes.

They're like pure distilled experience that it took somebody else years to amass but takes you a few hours to absorb the critical lessons from. Thank you it's about time I started reading them Twilight books i got there.I just started reading the Harry Potter series to my kids as their bedtime story, partly because I just want to *(edit: re-)*read them for myself. It's a big jump from The Cat in the Hat and Amelia Bedelia, and I can FEEL my brain doing more work, especially coming up with questions to keep the kids engaged as we go along. I love it. 

Update: We read Chapter 4 last night, and the girls stayed in their beds to listen! Next up, Diagon Alley! Can't go out tonight guys, it's cooking night  and no Bob you can't come, after the toast fiasco.I suggest [/r/gifrecipes]

This is like saying "Oh I could never go to the gym, I'm out of shape."Any type of meditation/ online resource you can recommend?That doesn't sound right, but I don't know enough about jars to dispute it.#quickmaths[deleted]What if you work thereIn a few years, you'll be spending your whole day working out! Hehe I'm currently at 1954 rep/day. Had to leave my wife, quit my job and say good bye to my friends. Have no more time left.Increase by one rep a day and add in a run, and soon...  

***ONE PUUUUUUUUUNCH!!***I sort of did this with running. In mid-September, I couldn't do more than 2 minutes on a treadmill. Completely exhausted.

Next day, I tried to go 3 minutes, the next day 4, and so on, at least 1/2 minute more every time I ran, 5 days a week.
 
Last night: 4 miles. I'm running in my first race ever on Thanksgiving morning. 

And, if it's relevant, I'm an elderredditor: 60 years old in March. I've been doing that with just push-ups. Today is day 93!Dogs are great solutions for this. 

Can’t afford a dog? Go to a shelter and play with one for free! As long as you have self control that is. 

My Great Dane has cheered me up on so many occasions, and honestly just the fact that he needs to be cared for has gotten me out of bed on days when my depression was super bad. Haha jokes on you, I'm incredibly lonelyStep one: get an SO. Good tip though I have learned to enjoy flossing. It has become a ritual and it's a time of peace and quiet to reflect upon the day. The movements have become second nature, so I'm flossing away on auto pilot and think about all the weird shit that's going on.People smoke 35 cigarettes per day?Nah, too messy.  Just start at 365 on day one and go from there.I remember a joke about this where a guy did it and got down to one smoke a day.

He felt great, wasn't coughing up all the time, could go out for a run without choking, and so on.

So he thought, *"If I feel this good on one cigarette a day, surely two wouldn't hurt..."*How many cigarettes is 34,8? I dont get it

Edit: for north americans: 34.8How do i stop procrastinating, do you have any tips?>until you reach typing-like speeds

I type 150 WPM, wish me luck boysThis is true. You can make your writing as nice as you want, but it requires actually writing. Not sure how that gets lost on people. I wasn't born with a fancy signature. This actually makes me really sad for some reason. I guess it makes me feel old. I've heard years ago that they were no longer teaching penmanship in schools and I thought it was silly, but now, hearing you help other people learn how to write is, in a way, heart breaking. 

It took no time at all to learn in school and most schools (with the exception of Catholic school) didn't grade you on your ability. It was taught "just because" and I remember feeling like I learned a secret language when I could finally read cursive. 

It's weird, to hear about a drastic change and then hang around long enough to see the effects of it. Skincare is one of the biggest YMMV imo.

My skin hates moisturisers.[deleted]TIL that exercise makes you 2" taller.Weirdest thing is, as much as I believe this is a joke, and as much as I'm not going to do it myself, I can actually imagine it *works*.This is the second thread I've seen you talk about buttplugs in Can’t tell if serious.You could start even smaller than that: if you're making a meal you like, make a larger portion so that you can save it for leftovers. Instant meal prep!
Yes it will take a little longer to cook and it will be a little more expensive, but you're investing in not having to cook and pay for another meal later in the week.Chew my food?? Is that why people give me weird stares when I swallow my pizza whole?I work with a guy who has a small cup of coffee throughout the whole working day. 8 hours and 1 small cup... I have coffee, pint of water, tea, then another pint. I'd feel so dry if I only drank that.My office has a water dispenser in the hallway. I love it. I probably drink 4 or 5 glasses throughout the day. I get a little dehydrated on the weekends though because I don't have that convenient water dispenser to use.Couch to 5k is a handy app to help you build up your running. "You're definitely qualified for this job. Will you take it?"

"Hold on I'll be right back"“Hmmmm should I masturbate today?”I don't know if this is good advice for women, I've tried it before and it turns into an hour long + procrastibation session#**But without porn!**Think Dr Jason Fung (dietician(?)) says  instead removing/adding something each month try *replacing* something with it. I've seen people eat way too much and justify it by saying that they had salad with it.Apples are freakishly good right now.

I can't even handle how good they are. 1 hour is good but not everyone can/wants to do that. Starting out you might only read 5 pages per day. Once you make it a habit you can read 1 hour per day.Audiobook in the commute baby!For about six months, I'd have breakfast at home, elevenses at work, lunch at work, snack at second break, and then be starving for dinner after work. If I missed any of these, I felt miserably hungry, like I would be sick if I didn't eat.

I found that I needed to cut back on my spending in the lunch room, so I started doing keto and just dealing with the hungry. Now, I rarely have anything before 4pm during the workweek and I feel better, less hungry, more able to focus on my work. I haven't lost any significant weight, maybe five pounds in the last two months, but it sure made a difference in how I feel.

That "breakfast is the most important meal" line is crap. It's a marketing phrase, not medical advice.Nice try mom!See, I hate made beds. I hate tucked-in sheets and blankets, and the first thing I do at a hotel is unmake the bed. They're so uncomfortable. Give me a nest, dammit!I'm happy coming home to my bed regardless of the position of the coversI can't even do threeSpot on! My garage used to be a huge mess. Well, it still is, but used to be a whole lot worse. I got one rolling toolbox from my dad, then bought another one from Harbor Freight. I also put up a peg-board and keep installing hooks on the wall, wherever possible. I labelled the toolbox drawers, and whenever I finish a job, all of my tools have a place to go, instead of staying out on the work bench. My garage is not perfect, but is much more workable these days.I just make a point to sort things from the chair once or twice a week. That Psych professor from Canada has a writing suite like this called self-authoring. We did it for an HR thing.I hadn't heard about this but maybe 5 years back I was really kind of lost for what to do with my life and felt pretty out of wack and I up and decided to start journaling every day. I'd write through my problems and feelings and generally make positive affirmations. I can't say for sure that it was a major factor because at the same time I was really kicking myself into gear, but things have turned around for me dramatically since then. I don't do the journaling anymore, but would definitely consider it if I hit some major adversity again.My old roommate had this same routine, clean the thing, use the thing. Then, 99% of the time, the thing is dirty!

It's the same amount of work to do it in the opposite order: use the thing, clean the thing. Then, when you don't use the thing for a while, it's not destructive or gross and the default state is *clean*.My soda addiction turned into a La Croix addiction. Same cost but I lost 40 lbs so I call it a win.7-8 lbs in less than 2 months is a lot! Well, that's frightening. 

edit: Just checked my savings. Looks like, in the event of a financial crisis my plan is *WEEEEEEEE! :(*I'm slightly annoyed that they keep using "6 out of 10 Americans" rather than "3 out of 5" in that article.I don’t know if that’s accurate.  The way the article phrases the question, I would have to put it on a credit card, but I have a pretty healthy 401k for a 27 year old.Yes, yes, yes! I hate to sound like your old man, but **everyone** should be taking advantage of savings plans. Some employers will match up to a certain percentage of what you sock away; you should definitely put in *at least* that percentage. It's free money. Every time you get a raise? Increase your automatic savings by that much. Got a bonus? Automatically put half of it in savings, and you still have half leftover to play with. Even without raises and bonuses, you should be re-evaluating at least once a year (like right after you file taxes) to see if you can save more money.I do this for health reasons but the money saved is a nice bonusI started making everything to a round £10 in my account recently. So if I had £175.89 I would move the £5.89 to savings. I do this a few times a week and it really builds up and it’s not money you’d miss much. My problem is I've been doing that for so many years now that I don't have anything else I can realistically cut out. And I'm still poor.TREAT. YO. SELF.This.  I started saving money when i started my family and bought a house 10 years ago.  Nowadays I can afford to buy whatever... but I feel like I shouldn't still...That's important. I have a friend that has a *ton* of money saved up (well, a couple thousand but we're in college so that's huge), but it's only because he never lets himself spend money so he still ends up living like he's just as broke as me. 

I mean obviously saving too much money is a lot better than spending too much money, but you have to find a balance.It was awesome when I realized I could do little tasks when I would normally just stare at a timer.  Microwaving left overs?  Time to wipe off the counter or change the trash in the kitchen.  Waiting for water to boil?  Vacuum the living room.  240 second respawn timer in Rust?  Unload the dishwasher and set the pans out for the next meal.  And the best part is, it's not time missed in the slightest.  It's time I would have done absolutely nothing else so why not knock out a few tasks that so easily build up and create this mental dam of motivation?Surely you don't need to masturbate *that* much.It’s as if thousands of 2 minute tasks suddenly cried out in terror, then were suddenly completed.I like to treat my future self as my buddy, and do nice things for him. Then when I notice I get to thank my past self for being cool.That edit was a beautiful read. Thank you.Started flossing regularly about 6 months ago. I'm going to the dentist in a couple of weeks. I'm excited to be able to do this!I flossed this morning for the first time in a while and it was a bloody mess. Last time I went it wasn't a question. 

She said, "I can see you floss regularly." 

I said, "How can you tell?" 

"Your gums look really healthy."What an inconsiderate piece of shitDental hygiene has no bounds*Continues browsing Reddit in bed*>*Comments on comment while laying in bed*

FTFYI can't think of any.No, not that :/In 5 years I’d be lucky to have $5. I so very rarely use cash that I’d accumulate change so slowly.sleep hygiene is huuuuge. I used to have medication induced insomnia. Switched medications about 3 years ago but the paranoia surrounding it hasn't left - nor have the habits. I still stop drinking caffeinated beverages at 11am, and will not eat anything with caffeine in it after 2pm (chocolate, etc). I also don't nap and avoid sleeping in for more than 2 hours. I also have a "wind-down" time that begins abt an hour before I expect to go to sleep. Life. It's okay, I don't have friends. *cries*Late to bed, late to rise, yes those are bags under my eyes.I do this during the week:

*  22:30 bedtime 
* 06:00 wake up

Then on the Friday I go straight from work to see friends if I can and Ill keep on going until the early hours. 

Because I have conditioned myself to get up early I will never sleep past 10 on a Saturday even if out the night before.  Im a soldier and I don't know what is that thing 'sleep' yall talking aboutI wake up at 6:30 on weekends. It feels great like there's an extra few hours to get everything I want to do in that I can't when I'm tired and it's dark in the evening.Plant Nanny made me feel so guilty. Don't you people get thirsty? Why do you need to remember to drink extra when your body tells you how much you need?

Edit: [Adam Ruins Everything did an episode on hydration](https://youtu.be/OWASUMMQjj8)[deleted]I like to walk up escalators and *really* win. Only if you can do it without gasping for breath and sweating profusely.Bring a change of clothesThis gonna be on that wholesome memes Facebook page.The first thing on my to do list has been "stop procrastinating" for quite some time.That's awesome, good for you. What time have you been going to bed/waking up?While I totally agree, how the fuck do you shotgun a protein bar?I grew up with a hoarder too. I have to say out loud, "pick it up and put it where it goes," for trash, socks, groceries, etc. Its crazy how much it affected me. *Dishwasher*? Well la-di-da.

(PS communism will win)...in a manner of speaking.He hasn’t learned those three yet.Cerveza por favor!

Few days ago, I decided to bike to my work and ride moderate distance after work. (10-15 kms.) Best decision ever. It is helping me mentally and physically. I just become happy and relieved when I ride my bike. Also, it has low impact on your knees./r/bodyweightfitness

Visit it. Especially if you want to workout at home with (almost) no equipment.Look up 7 minute workout on your smartphone's store. Even 15 minutes everyday is a huge improvementGenerally strenuous excercise like running is best, but anything is better than nothing. 

Edit - I would define "strenuous" for most as anything that increases your heart rate by a significant amount. *Generally speaking* the higher intensity your activity is the better it is for you, but be aware of your body/limitations and don't hurt yourself 100 situps, 100 squats, 100 pushups and running 10km every dayI've been without soda for like 3-4 months, and I do not feel better.  I feel like I had a really bad breakup, and everywhere I go, people are making out with my lover in front of me.  And she wants me back man.  that's the worst part about it.  Dr pepper is calling for me everyday, and I want nothing more than to go running back, but I can't...I just...can't...Yea but some people don't like that weird waterry - non sprite taste 

(me)How much time did you spending waiting on your milk?Funny enough, I have issues with keeping my weight UP, so my 1.5 litres of milk a day is probably the only thing keeping me up thereTo be fair, I always had dogs growing up and we never walked them because we lived on 7 acres in the woods with no neighbors. We just let our dogs roam around our land and explore on their own. Of course, we also spent time outside with them playing, but until I moved to the city and got a dog of my own I had never walked one before despite always having them (and wanting so badly to walk a pup). Some advice where I fell short with my pup: separate the walk from the bathroom. Like take to one area until they go, and then take them on a walk as a reward, and take them in if they don’t go. it will be a lot of in and out and standing around but it will be so worth it when it’s rainy or cold out and you need them to just do their business ASAP. I tried this and gave up quickly but wish i stuck with it. Now some mornings I’m walking for 40 minutes in the cold sometimes because he knows once he goes, it’s time to head back home and the walk is over Plenty of people treat their dogs horribly. Far worse than not walking them. 

You will be a good dog parent I thinkAbsolutely, taking less food like that helps a lot, even eating on smaller plates can help visually imo.Why not both? There's many other benefits to exercising outside of weightloss.Bonus points for being honest about why you're saying no. When I ask a buddy of mine to go somewhere or do something, and he doesn't want to, he'll politely say "I don't really want to do that". 

It kinda caught me off guard at first because normally people will offer you an excuse of some sort, but I respect him more for it. That's a good one too.  
  
Another good one I picked up from my dad is "look like you belong and people will usually assume you do". As an amateur photographer, this is great for getting into cool places.For example. I got an earlier flight and business plus on both flights for free yesterday, simply because I asked. I was going to have a 7 hour layover in Chicago. Instead I had a early flight out of Dayton and connected in Charlottesville for like 30 minutes of layover, getting home about four hours earlier. The only problem with this is that nobody likes 'that guy'. He always wants and it can seem like entitlement. This is the type who gets talked about and while he may get cool free stuff, I'd never offer him anything and if I had stuff to give out, I'd start at the opposite end of the room. I think while in a similar vein this is was more literal , as in "Ask for something that you fully expect the answer to be no to " like "Hey major league grounds keeper can run around the bases" or "Hey Steven Spielberg  would you read my screen play?"  Using  extreme examples that would be more universally understood.

The person giving the advice was a photographer so  for them it was likely asking to take photos.  So the overall goal was to get great rare/exclusive photos. 

The point is if the goal is

1)try to get rejected it will work out on occasion and it's much easier on people mentally if you move the goalpost from "get backstage at a concert" to "be to told no".  It's done in low close rate sales too; if the close rate is 1 in 100 and you need to sell 5 change the goal from "sell 5" to "be told no 500 time." Because failing 99 times fucks with your head but succeeding at being told no 100 you're 1/5 of the way to your goal.  Or if you want a better job , instead of "I will get a better job" , "I will apply for a job every job" 

2) to stop pre rejecting yourself.  Using the job example from above.  If you want a better job and see an ad for one you want but are just a bit under-qualified for you may not apply but if you change the goal to "Apply for a job everyday " Sending off that resume is just ticking off your To Do for the day just by sending it you have completed your goal.  

3) because the goal is to be rejected you keep reaching a little father. You don't play it safe and only ask people who will say yes.  E.g you don't only ask to run the bases at public parks (where the answer will virtually always be yes) you ask at a minor league park where the answer is still likely to be "No"  His TedTalk inspired me so hard i went out and just did shit. Fuck rejection, chase your fears. Wow, I remember when he started this series on YouTube a few years ago. It's really awesome and motivating to see how his experiment turned out and blew up :)I remember that guy. A lot of you probably saw the outcomes of one of these days. He asked a Krispy Kreme worker to make donuts in to look like the Olympic rings, and the worker actually did it for him. It went viral and the employee was recognized by the internet as being pretty awesome for actually doing it. Nice story.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ax2CsVbrX0In those two minutes could you tell her the reason you needed to make out? Or could you not use meta?This sounds like mono breeding ground> In 2 minutes you need to find someone, and make out with them. If you got rejected, you were paying for drinks for the rest of the night.

Couldn't you just do each other and drink for free?Just ask yourself "is this something I would do?" if it is, then don't do it.For people like you, ignore the Dwight technique.  You need a more advanced tool.  For you, I recommend, The Costanza.  In this technique, you always do the opposite of what you would normally do.  For example, you'd normally never walk up to that cute waitress,  and tell her you are unemployed and live with your parents, before asking her out.  Therefore, you should do that.  No Patrick.It really is just that easy. Just play everyday for at least 30 mins and you'll become a better person for it.

I used to be under the impression that only a "chosen few" could become good at an instrument. That you had to be born with it. Because of this I didn't pick up an instrument until I was 16.

But it really is just as easy as playing it every day. The goal isn't even to be the best at it, the goal is the authentic happiness gained from discipline and dedication. And if you find your niche, you can still strive to be the best at that.

Just don't expect to be the worlds greatest technical musician if you didn't start at 2 years old. Find other sources of fulfillment than winning, and just be the best artist you can be.Refrigerator.I completely agree. Except I always feel like I read things and think, "wow that's genius. If I can absorb this, it'll change my life." One month later, and I have 0 recollection of these concepts. As much as I (and at least half the internet) likes to rag on those books, she did make a not-so-small fortune with those books. If nothing else, they're a decent guideline on how to write books that seem to have mass appeal.PSA: A lot of those recipes are seriously flawed because the main goal is to be visually entertaining.  Check the comments, and don't be afraid to tweak them.  Great if you really want puff pastry as a corner stone of your diet./r/meditation is a great resource as they know more about the long term practice than i do.

So true...I've spent thousands on products, doctors, and services. One day I got so fed up I stopped using everything. Magically, my skin has never been better.

I'm one of those guys.  I do get dehydrated, but I don't really notice it / it doesn't bother me.   So I'll go entire days without drinking anything.

Helped me a lot figuring out unnecessary expenses that were overlooked otherwise.BRB buying a batman suit And here we are on reddit, wasting away our 2 minute tasks. My house could be spotless, had i just put the phone down and just do all the 2 minute choresI also find myself being way more efficient when there is an arbitrary clock placed on a task, in a weird way it can even become fun (I guess it's a form of gamifying chores/life).

One fun timer is when you are melting butter in a frying pan because it places a hard limit on the timer but there is also wiggle room, and worst case scenario you waste 10cents of butter and have to rewash the pan.You don't knoooow meAt work drinking tea ... Laughed so hard I farted. 

Good work. Ooohhh, I like this mentality. Maybe that'll convince me to drag my sorry ass to the gym more than twice a week, and stop skipping leg day, lol.

"Damn past me, thanks for these lean af quads" looolEnjoy your significantly less painful cleaning![deleted]He probably just learned and wanted to show offLike, uh, handholding[deleted]Sure you do. It's that thing you do from 0130-0140, 0602-0612, 1145-1200, 1800-1807, and 2133-2139.I tend to get either focused on what I am doing (even if it's only redditing) and not notice things like being thirsty.  Or I'm jumping from one thing to the next my kids asking for one thing after the other and everytime I head to the table to grab my water bottle for a drink somebody needs something, I get it then I see socks on the floor and pick them up, then I remembered I need to send an email and sit down at my computer forget why and open facebook,. . .  Next thing I know 2 hours later I still haven't gotten that drink.You'll probably want to make base camp around floor 50, head for the summit in the morning. And running shoes. that's too broad. you have to split that up~9pm bedtime/ ~5am wake-up.

Honestly start feeling soo good and productive that I don't care about staying up late.
Deep throat it.

Ask your mom if you have technique questions I grew up in such a household with the added bonus of not just junk but cats too. As a penance I married a German. "Don't put it down, put it away."I think I need to get my girlfriend some help. Her mother is a hoarder and she constantly just leaves things wherever she happens to be standing.Dishes? Pfeh. Back in my day we ate nothing off of nothing, and bawhgawd we liked it.She, and I did ;)Exactly. I used to work downtown- 45 minutes by car...55 minutes by bike, plus weight loss and stress buster. Kind of hard during our winters though.These guys do great work. I found them about a year after I started and they were great to chat with. They do their best to provide quality info,too. If anyone spouts nonsense they get hit with downvotes and counter arguments. They promote what is true and denounce what is false. Fantastic community to be sure.

I can't recommend exercise enough. It's an incredible feeling to workout in your own home and get leaps and bounds stronger than you ever were within the span of a few months,and then to continue getting stronger than you thought was possible before you started.

When I started exercising on 1/1/16 I could do 7 pushups,0 dips and 2 eccentric pullups

Today I can do pushups with 200lbs on my back,dips with 110lbs strapped to my waist and pullups with 95lbs strapped to my waist. I can also perform freestanding handstand pushups,front levers(single leg for now)and currently working towards an 11 second 100m sprint time(12.2 right now)

I was 19 when I started and my legs burned when I got off the couch. Hell,my hands shook when I picked up milk to pour into my cereal. Exercise has completely changed my life for the better and I will train 6 days a week until I die. Training has made me happier than i've ever been.

TL;DR *Please,please exercise**
you'll love it I promise!7-minute workout?  Listen to this.  6... minute... workout.  Think about it. You go to the app store.  You see 7-minute workout sittin' there.  There's 6-minute workout right beside it.  Which one are you gonna pick, man?  Bingo, man, bingo.  6-minute workout. And if you can't exercise much, walking for one hour a day is great.No i like my hair thanks you.I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine. In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”Haha Dr Pepper is the only soda I really liked and they replaced it in the soda machine at work. If it's any consolation, you'll get over that feeling. For me it's cigarettes and 3-4 months isn't enough time to break a habit. Give it a year and you won't even notice people drinking soda.I used to hate plain sparkling water, but now it's my go to when I'm craving soda-like substances. The best part is I don't feel like shit after drinking it like I do with sodahoof an hour 

Edit: Thanks kind stranger for popping my Reddit gold cherry! Turns out you're lactose intolerant and the ensuing explosive diarrhea is why you can't gain weight! Yeah I don't think any of these comments are aimed at situations like yours. Just city dogs not getting that freedom and excersize.I've been eating less for a few months now. I've lost nearly 25 pounds in about 5 months without changing my exercise at all. You're correct, and people should do both. For weight-loss, however, burning calories takes more time than not eating the calories in the first place. My go to is, "let me think about it"

And then I avoid that person until the heat death of the universe. >  getting into cool places

Like Gitmo, probably.My 7th and 8th grade English teacher similarly said "fake it till you make it." 

She was oddly very encouraging when students could creatively fake their creative writing reports.

One student turned in "this is a story about writers block" and she ate it up. /r/actlikeyoubelongI tried this on United and got my ass beat.I think, like most things in life, it's all about moderation. People who do this in a reasonable fashion aren't automatically disliked.I guess it depends on how you go about it. If you ask nicely that is one thing, but if you *demand* extras, that is pure entitlement. For example if I am taking a flight somewhere, when I am checking in I will ask politely if there is *any chance* whatsoever that maybe an upgraded seat is available and if I could possibly get it on the house. sometimes the answer is an equally polite no and sometimes I will get it. Whereas if I would go up and **demand** to be upgraded for free then I would come off as an entitled douche bag and would probably end up getting worse service because of it. 

It's all in the presentation.Yeh the person who badgers the busy hotel receptionist for a free upgrade might get it, but everyone behind him in the line hates him and the receptionist would love to kick him out The job one rings true for me... I'm a college dropout, pretty technically competent, and good at talking to people. I was selling office supplies for $13.50/hr, but it was a small company and really no potential for career or income growth. So I applied to ten software sales jobs a day. For like a year. And eventually I got a BDR role at a smallish tech company, mostly because I think they wanted to give me a shot. I was promoted several times and learned a lot about the industry, and software in general. I took every opportunity to train or grow that was provided to me. 

Four years later I'm starting at a new company, because my experience allows me to be selective. I'm making a little less than 10 times what I was just four years ago. Thank you for the elaboration on OP's advice. My general life philosophy is "expect the worst, and you're either correct or pleasantly surprised", but I still struggle real hard with rejection and anxiety about that. Reframing it like you said turns rejection into the expectation, which makes every "yes" a bonus. I'm going to try to incorporate this outlook into my life.[Link for the lazy.](https://www.ted.com/talks/jia_jiang_what_i_learned_from_100_days_of_rejection)That was against the rulesThe club I mainly tried this in was actually called Mono, I shit you not So you get this really interesting trend, if you start following that advice.

Let's say our pal Ed over here really likes buttered toast. He would like to eat some buttered toast. He asks himself, "Is eating buttered toast something I would do?" The answer is most definitely yes. So Ed does not eat the buttered toast.

We fast forward a bit, and Ed has not eaten buttered toast in the past year. He would like to eat some buttered toast. "Is eating buttered toast something I would do?" He thinks back to the past year, and the answer is definitely no, he does not eat buttered toast. So Ed eats the buttered toast.

You get this really cool oscillation between being an idiot and not being an idiot, if you don't know what an idiot is and suspect that you may be an idiot. To be fair, if she can look past all that, she's probably a keeper. 

Or just has incredibly low self-esteem.Horseradish is not an instrument either.It's cheesy, but if you're working on something, it really does help to pick a character and think "Okay, what would _this_ guy do here?"  A task at work, a recipe you're working on, a project you're trying to commit to, whatever.

Even if all it does is add a little flair, it usually gives you a small burst of motivation to at least get started.Maintain a book or app where you note there quotes and sources and tag them accordingly. You can read through it 4 times a year.Their simplicity makes them addictive reads as well, I enjoyed themCheers! I started using Headspace recently but am looking to branch out, will check out Sharon Salzburg soon :)NoStill got my thorlike hair tho100 push-ups 100 sit-ups run 10 km everyday.
No heat in the winter no AC in the summer. I'm sure I'm missing somethinghell, I used to smoke two packs a day working at build a bear. luckily I'm only 24 and I've cut it down to more like 5-10 cigs a day instead of 40The filter, preferably.With a name like Reddit-Loves-Me. I would expect nothing more than living with your spouse Snuu.Huh. Never thought of it that way. Never look down and don't focus on what keys you're typing. Just let your hands go with the flow of your thoughts (that includes if you're transcribing from something visual). People tend to think too much when they try to type faster. I just kind of get into a zen state when I really go to town. 

And practice. I got my speed way up when I was in typing class in high school (late 90s). I went from 90 wpm to a consistent 125 wpm. Those typing trainer programs are really helpful. That and I thrive off a challenge. If you do too, set a goal and hit it. Then try to beat that goal. Just keep going like that.Maybe buy a nice water bottle and have it with you at work or just have a cup a water nearby at all times. You will learn to drink automatically if its right there.can you name a more important decision!?Until your old and frail and have to do thousandsWhen I did the math on th cost of my( and my gf) La Croix addiction, I bought a soda stream and mostly drink water from that now. Saving money and calories!I did this too. Helped float us a few times and avoid an overdraft fee
I have my debit card setup that every time I use it it rounds up the charge to the next $5 increment and moves that to my saving account. They call it Bank the rest. It's seems silly but it's a simple way to save a little bit automatically.Yeah but I'm busy writing comments that also take under 2 minutes.That's why you use your poop time to Reddit! :pLook at Mr. Moneybags over here...Nice, Mrs Pancakes.Then let me get to know you, dammit!You do know me *sniffle*I've been flossing daily for almost a year now, and I can't believe what a difference it has made at my Hygeine appointments. what if i can't floss most of my teeth because they're very close together and the floss doesn't fit between them? in my country flossing is basically not a thing so i've never been told by my dentist to do it at all, let alone how to do it correctly.***Disgusting***I’ve been using Qapital for the past two months. Saved around $50 in the first month without even thinking about it. You can set you quirky rules too, like save money whenever the temperature outside hits 90 or below 0, or every time you work out, save $1 or whatever. It’s pretty neat, and accrues .1% interest!Whoa a full 15 before lunch? What is he? Air Force?Should I bring oxygen tanks?List now has two items: "Stop" and "Procrastinating." Am I doing this right?Damn, that's awesome. I don't know if I could do that. I go to bed at 3am and wake up at 11 on the weekends and 1am and 7am on the weekdays. But I'm not wasting time, I'm doing work the whole time. Once I'm financially comfortable hopefully I'll be able the adjust my sleeping schedule.That's a hefty penance.... "Use your head to save your heels"  was my grandmother's idiom about this. 

Everytime I drop something where it doesn't go I hear her saying this in my brain.Or once it's already down, "don't pass it up, pick it up."Be gentle. It took me a long, long time to "see" the mess I was living in when I moved out. My housemates would take the piss about my messy room, but all students were messy! I couldn't believe the towering boxes of junk I'd brought with me from my parents house were messy. The were so neatly stacked!

It took me a long, long time to be comfortable throwing things away. Start slowly with her. Maybe take photos of the mess and show her. For some reason, my eyes would gloss over the real life mess but seeing it on a screen was more stark somehow... Good luck!/r/wewantplates would like a wordM'SeñoraHow about that 5 minute walk-out though.Walking or biking to work\school can make a Huge difference, and you won't feel like you don't have time to do it because you are simply commuting. I'd say that gaining the ability to punch fucking holes through giant monsters is a pretty good tradeoff for losing your hair. The problem is I'm 90% sure I'm going to get a dr pepper at the star wars premier.  Come on man..

*CALF an hour* !

EDIT: Thank you kind stranger for the gilding! And to all of the amazing contributors who kept this pun train going! Choo Choo... no wait, Moo Moo !!To me it sounds like dogs in a suburb where people just let them out in their backyard [deleted]I do that but with everyone and I don't say anything beforehandYou get to go waterboarding at the bay, sounds pretty fun to me! I used to think I was really good at bullshitting my papers.  
Turns out I'm just a good writer.> "this is a story about writers block"

That teacher and that paper sound like the best.SIR CALM DOWN!I think tact also plays a big role in the way this is approachedThat's not what this is about though.

This is more like, the guy who just politely asks for a free upgrade might get it, but everyone who doesn't definitely won't.I don't think anyone here is suggesting you be an ass about it. If you ask nicely and they say no, just drop it. Congratulations, you can now apply the "if you never ask for it, you'll never get it" principle without pissing anyone off.Was it a breeding ground, though?Are you from Dundee by any chance?u/Ed_ButteredToast is that you??  Same. It was written in a real high drama high school-y way that made it a page turner. Kinda like how delicious junk food is while eating it then afterwards you have a stomach ache...I’ve used Headspace for maybe a year now and I really recommend it. I’ve tried reading books on meditation, but at least for me, nothing was as practical or motivating as HeadspaceYes, that's how infinity works. You clearly didn't go to Number School.Time thor a haircut.Banana for breakfastYou were working at Build a Bear and spending $30/day on cigarettes?! I'm guessing you've experienced a major improvement in your finances too! Good question. Let me masturbate over this.I want to like them so bad. I drink an obnoxious amount of coke zero. I just want la croix but with a tiny bit of stevia added.I tried that, but my boss started asking why I was spending 5 hours a day pooping. "I Can't Believe it's Not Poverty"Real niceThen let me get to know you goddamnit!Moneybox in the UK is very similar to this and has worked wonders for me. Although doesn't have as many cool rules! I'd love to play around with that and see what I could save.Lunch? Prior AF and never heard of it.This is a legit strategy - walk around the house and take a video of everything then watch it back and be prepared for horror.Yes. The mess was more noticeable when I had kids and tried to get pictures of them. I'm doing better now. *tips sombrero*No! No, no, not 5. I said 6. Nobody's comin' up with 5. Who works out in 5 minutes? 7's the answer! 7 little chipmunks sitting on a branch, eating a bunch of sunflowers on my uncle's ranch.  You know that old children's tale from the sea!My dad started biking/walking to the train station from home for work about a year ago. Between that and dietary changes he’s lost about 40 pounds in the last two years.Sure but there is a serious lack of giant monster where i live.That's fine. I'm 90% sure I'm going to smoke cigarettes at my friends wedding in January. And I smoked like a chimney last week at my other friends wedding. If your vice is a treat, and not a habit, I don't see problems with that.The U.S. Government also gives you 24/7 room service and the resort is all inclusive. Why would he not go?Writing IS bullshitting.

I'm a professional writer and I've just gotten professionally good at bullshitting.Honestly this happened to me too. And the reason why we're decent at writing is (at least in my case) the many hours sunk into reading books when we were young. So, really, we're not bullshitting. We paid our dues. It's a pretty common paper topic, just like "how to give a speech" always seems to come up in speech class. I bet she was just happy the student felt clever and wrote something with a little feeling. 10/10 teacher, excited for the learning more than the paper.Yes. I feel like if you're the asshole that says, "Bro, can I get a discount?", I'm going to hate you.

If you're honest (or seem honest) about your situation, I might help out. Something like: "Hey, it's really hard for me to spend that much today. Is there any way you could help me out?"

Also, can people stop fucking haggling retail workers? It isn't the god damn peddlers mall, people.Happened to me just recently went on a Disney cruise with the kids. Before boarding, I asked if there were any available room upgrades. Ended up going from an inside room with no window on the back of the ship, to a balcony room a few floors up in the middle of the ship. Anyone who gets a bit seasick knows how much of a huge difference being midship can help. Would have cost us over $500 if we had booked that room prior and ended up in it no charge. Was great!

I asked nicely to upgrade my flight from coach to first class. The lady printed me out a ticket and that was how I got my first flight in first class with no charge. Based on this guy's strategy I'd say probably notNo I'm not from there, but that's where I went to uni a fair few years ago now, haha! I assume you know which club I'm on aboutಠ_ಠ  He went to infinity school, but he never got outI was 19 and a manager, I've wised up sinceThis is going to sound mean, but just add it in!  Snag a few packets and sprinkle it to taste whenever you drink it.  Things like Stevia won't mess with the carbonation noticeably, and neither will mixing it in as the bubbles will do most of the work for you.  :) He swapped the Br for an L for some reason.  In all my 12 years in teh AF I've never heard someone refer to Brunch that way.*catches salsa*You got a genuine belly laugh out of me from this.Can't even build a sweat in 5 mins!If you keep this regimen you _become_ the giant monster.Then it's settled!  I will let my wife know spaghettielee says its okay.  ;)I heard the music is sometimes way too loud.Professionals just learn how to structure and organize their bullshit> Also, can people stop fucking haggling retail workers? It isn't the god damn peddlers mall, people.

Oh god I could not believe how many people attempted this when I worked as a cashier at a home improvement store. 

People, if you think I have *any* ability to change the price of these bulk bin 5/8" galvanized nuts, you're delusional. Stop trying to haggle me down by like 2 cents a nut, it's not gonna happen because *I can't* change the price unless you've got proof someplace else sells them cheaper (and then we can price match). And saying "Uh, I think I remember (other home improvement store) had them for 5 cents less" is not proof!are you telling me I could have gotten free hotel upgrades all my life if I just asked nicely if there was an available upgrade? I always thought that if I asked for an upgrade I'd most definitely pay for itWas a solid strategyWhat a club!Infiniting to this very day+1 !It’s only a 10 credit program.
